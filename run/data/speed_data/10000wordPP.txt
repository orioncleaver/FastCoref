At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a veryfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought thesame, and added:“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellentwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She reallylooked almost wild.”“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Verynonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.”“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this wasall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.”“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make suchan exhibition.”“Certainly not.”“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean byit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum.”“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” saidBingley.“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a verysweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But withsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there isno chance of it.”“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton.”“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “andI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch herothers--all that his library afforded.“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into.”Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have leftso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of manygenerations.”“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buyingbooks.”“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.”“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley.”“I wish it may.”“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.”“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her verylittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drewnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and hiseldest sister, to observe the game.“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “willshe be as tall as I am?”“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, orrather taller.”“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted meso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplishedfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.”“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sureI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without beinginformed that she was very accomplished.”“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “hastoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of myacquaintance, that are really accomplished.”“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.”“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besidesall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half-deserved.”“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading.”“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?”“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe united.”Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, itsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.”Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.Chapter 9Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, andits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to bemoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.”“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal.”“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.”Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffersa vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they arenothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and acharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting itin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough I am afraid is pitiful.”“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were astudier of character. It must be an amusing study.”“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have atleast that advantage.”“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.”“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.”“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town.”Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph.“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But thatgentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothingat all.”“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,which you must acknowledge to be true.”“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towardsMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! Sogenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”“Did Charlotte dine with you?”“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. Formy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boastof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my ownpartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brotherGardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law wassure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, hedid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verseson her, and very pretty they were.”“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what isstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her partindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her owneasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was veryequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, andabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and whenyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day ofthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better towait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carterwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” sheadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell ColonelForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.Chapter 10The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and MissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs. Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetualcommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each.“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”He made no answer.“You write uncommonly fast.”“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mendpens remarkably well.”“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”“How can you contrive to write so even?”He was silent.“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to MissGrantley’s.”“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? Atpresent I have not room to do them justice.”“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for meto determine.”“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter withease, cannot write ill.”“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried herbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much forwords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”“My style of writing is very different from yours.”“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance ofhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes anindirect boast.”“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, youthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at thismoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you weremounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had betterstay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably notgo--and at another word, might stay a month.”“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.”“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such acircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Icould.”“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak forhimself.”“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, tostand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, andthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety.”“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no meritwith you.”“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither.”“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the parties?”“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, notforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have moreweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assureyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison withmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do notknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and inparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,when he has nothing to do.”Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense.“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,and want to silence this.”“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and MissBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be verythankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.Darcy had much better finish his letter.”Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabethfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, sheseated herself.Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-booksthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixedon her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,however, at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm bya lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her:“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reel?”She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence.“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tellyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me ifyou dare.”“Indeed I do not dare.”Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He reallybelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when thisdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour tocheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,which your lady possesses.”“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placedin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle thejudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in differentlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but theircolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might becopied.”At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself.“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard.“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away withouttelling us that you were coming out.”Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,and immediately said:“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into theavenue.”But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered:“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appearto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth. Good-bye.”She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.Chapter 11When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to hersister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into thedrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe anentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laughat their acquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressedhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst alsomade her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy andattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further fromthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyoneelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with MissBennet.Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of abook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have notan excellent library.”No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenlytowards him and said:“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance atNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consultthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure.”“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if hechooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settledthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall sendround my cards.”“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they werecarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day.”“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not benear so much like a ball.”Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; butDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. Inthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,turning to Elizabeth, said:“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take aturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.”Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy lookedup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be hismeaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severeon us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it.”Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives.“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soonas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secretaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would becompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much betteras I sit by the fire.”“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything soabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “Wecan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimateas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we willnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without asubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is anuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it wouldbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love alaugh.”“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of theiractions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a joke.”“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope Iam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are preciselywhat you are without.”“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridicule.”“Such as vanity and pride.”“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a realsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;“and pray what is the result?”“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns ithimself without disguise.”“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouchfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for theconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of othersso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temperwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lostforever.”“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. Ireally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particularevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstandthem.”“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of aconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind mywaking Mr. Hurst?”Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte wasopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry forit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.Chapter 12In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated onher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, whichwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, atleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare themvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on thecontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not besafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been atNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and MissBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they wereat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered mostconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almostall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her mosttenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennetwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But theirfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was reallyglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. Theevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much ofits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane andElizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and humannature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had informationfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and ithad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were atbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinnersare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to begot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill thismoment.”“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom Inever saw in the whole course of my life.”This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight agoI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiringearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thingin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long agoto do something or other about it.”Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. Theyhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on whichMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “andnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such falsefriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father didbefore him?”“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead, as you will hear.”“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.“Dear Sir,--“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had themisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; butfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--‘There, Mrs.Bennet.’--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for havingreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine deBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, Ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds Iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject theoffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise forit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection toreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennightfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--Iremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters, your well-wisher and friend,“WILLIAM COLLINS”“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.”“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him.”“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit.”Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required.“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make himout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose hewould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in hisletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seemdefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Ithink it is well expressed.”To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was atall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave andstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it mayprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled sooddly.”“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such thingsI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.”“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted--”He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on eachother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. Thehall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. Hebegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hour.During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. LadyCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration forhis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspecthe protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening. Lady
