ALICE'S_ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

Lewis_Carroll

CHAPTER_I. Down the_Rabbit - Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her_sister on the
bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the
book her_sister was reading , but it had no_pictures or conversations in
it , ' and what is the_use of a_book , ' thought Alice ' without pictures or
conversations ? '

So she was considering in her_own_mind ( as well as she could , for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure
of making a_daisy - chain would be worth the_trouble of getting up and
picking the_daisies , when suddenly_a_White_Rabbit with pink_eyes ran
close by her .

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the_way to hear the_Rabbit say to itself , ' Oh dear !
Oh dear ! I shall be late ! ' ( when she thought it over afterwards , it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the_time
it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the_Rabbit actually TOOK A_WATCH
OUT OF ITS_WAISTCOAT - POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on ,
Alice started to her_feet , for it flashed across her_mind that she had
never before seen a_rabbit with either_a_waistcoat - pocket , or a_watch
to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the_field
after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit - hole under the_hedge .

In another_moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how
in the_world she was to get out again .

The_rabbit - hole went straight on like a_tunnel for some_way , and then
dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well .

Either the_well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next . First , she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she
looked at the_sides of the_well , and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book - shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs . She took down a_jar from one of the_shelves as
she passed ; it was labelled ' ORANGE_MARMALADE ' , but to her great
disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the_jar for fear
of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the_cupboards as
she fell past it .

' Well ! ' thought Alice to herself , ' after such a fall as this , I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! How brave they 'll all think me at
home ! Why , I would n't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top
of the_house ! ' ( Which was very likely true . )

Down , down , down . Would the_fall NEVER come to an_end ! ' I wonder how
many miles I 've fallen by this_time ? ' she said aloud . ' I must be getting
somewhere near the_centre of the_earth . Let me see : that would be four
thousand miles down , I think-- ' ( for , you see , Alice had learnt several
things of this_sort in her_lessons in the_schoolroom , and though this
was not a_VERY_good_opportunity for showing off her_knowledge , as there
was no_one to listen to her , still it was good_practice to say it over )
' --yes , that 's about the_right_distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I 've got to ? ' ( Alice had no_idea what Latitude was , or
Longitude either , but thought they were nice_grand_words to say . )

Presently she began again . ' I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
earth ! How funny it 'll seem to come out among the_people that walk with
their_heads downward ! The_Antipathies , I think-- ' ( she was rather glad
there WAS no_one listening , this time , as it did n't sound at all the
right_word ) ' --but I shall have to ask them what the_name of the_country
is , you know . Please , Ma'am , is this_New_Zealand or Australia ? ' ( and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you 're falling
through the_air ! Do you think you could manage it ? ) ' And what an
ignorant_little_girl she 'll think me for asking ! No , it 'll never do to
ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . '

Down , down , down . There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began
talking again . ' Dinah'll miss me very much to - night , I should think ! '
( Dinah was the_cat . ) ' I hope they 'll remember her_saucer of milk at
tea - time . Dinah my_dear ! I wish you were down here with me ! There are no
mice in the_air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a_bat , and that 's very
like a_mouse , you know . But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? ' And here_Alice
began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy
sort of way , ' Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ? ' and sometimes , ' Do
bats eat cats ? ' for , you see , as she could n't answer either_question ,
it did n't much matter which way she put it . She felt that she was dozing
off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ' Now , Dinah , tell me the_truth :
did you ever eat a_bat ? ' when suddenly,_thump ! thump ! down she came upon
a_heap of sticks and dry_leaves , and the_fall was over .

Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her_feet in a_moment :
she looked up , but it was all_dark_overhead ; before her was another
long_passage , and the_White_Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
There was not_a_moment to be lost : away went Alice like the_wind , and
was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a_corner , ' Oh my_ears
and_whiskers , how late it's_getting ! ' She was close behind it when she
turned the_corner , but the_Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found
herself in a_long,_low_hall , which was lit up by a_row of lamps hanging
from the_roof .

There were doors all round the_hall , but they were all locked ; and when
Alice had been all_the_way down one_side and up the other , trying every
door , she walked sadly down the_middle , wondering how she was ever to
get out again .

Suddenly she came upon a_little_three - legged_table , all made of solid
glass ; there was nothing on it except a_tiny_golden_key , and Alice 's
first_thought was that it might belong to one of the_doors of the_hall ;
but , alas ! either_the_locks were too large , or the_key was too small ,
but at any_rate it would not open any of them . However , on the second
time round , she came upon a_low_curtain she had not noticed before , and
behind it was a_little_door about fifteen inches high : she tried the
little_golden_key in the_lock , and to her_great_delight it fitted !

Alice opened the_door and found that it led into a_small_passage , not
much larger than a_rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the_passage
into the_loveliest_garden you ever saw . How she longed to get out of
that_dark_hall , and wander about among those_beds of bright_flowers and
those_cool_fountains , but she could not even get her_head through the
doorway ; ' and even if my_head would go through,'_thought_poor_Alice , ' it
would be of very_little_use without my_shoulders . Oh , how I wish I could
shut up like a_telescope ! I think I could , if I only knew how to begin . '
For , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately ,
that Alice had begun to think that very_few_things indeed were really
impossible .

There seemed to be no_use in waiting by the_little_door , so she went
back to the_table , half hoping she might find another_key on it , or at
any_rate_a_book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this
time she found a_little_bottle on it , [ ' which certainly was not here
before , ' said Alice , ) and round the_neck of the_bottle was a_paper
label , with the_words ' DRINK_ME ' beautifully printed on it in large
letters .

It was all very well to say ' Drink me , ' but the_wise_little_Alice was
not going to do THAT in a_hurry . ' No , I 'll look first , ' she said , ' and
see whether it 's marked <unconvertable> poison <unconvertable> or not ' ; for she had read several nice
little_histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild
beasts and other_unpleasant_things , all because they WOULD not remember
the_simple_rules their_friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a_knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never
forgotten that , if you drink much from a_bottle marked ' poison , ' it is
almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .

However , this_bottle was NOT marked ' poison , ' so Alice ventured to taste
it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed_flavour
of cherry - tart , custard , pine - apple , roast_turkey , toffee , and hot
buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

' What a_curious_feeling ! ' said Alice ; ' I must be shutting up like a
telescope . '

And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her_face
brightened up at the_thought that she was now the_right_size for going
through the_little_door into that_lovely_garden . First,_however,_she
waited for a_few_minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further :
she felt a little nervous about this ; ' for it might end , you know , ' said
Alice to herself , ' fwmy going out altogether , like a_candle . I wonder
what I should be like then ? ' And she tried to fancy what the_flame of a
candle is like after the_candle is blown out , for she could not remember
ever having seen such_a_thing .

After a_while , finding that_nothing more happened , she decided on going
into the_garden at once ; but , alas for poor_Alice ! when she got to the
door , she found she had forgotten the_little_golden_key , and when she
went back to the_table for it , she found she could not possibly reach
it : she could see it quite plainly through the_glass , and she tried her
best to climb up one of the_legs of the_table , but it was too slippery ;
and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing
sat down and cried .

' Come , there 's no_use in crying like that ! ' said Alice to herself ,
rather sharply ; ' I advise you to leave off this_minute ! ' She generally
gave herself very good advice , ( though she very seldom followed it ) ,
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her_eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her_own_ears for having
cheated herself in a_game of croquet she was playing against herself ,
for this_curious_child was very fond of pretending to be two_people .
' But it 's no_use now , ' thought poor_Alice , ' to pretend to be two_people !
Why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person ! '

Soon her_eye fell on a_little_glass_box that was lying under the_table :
she opened it , and found in it a_very_small_cake , on which the_words
' EAT_ME ' were beautifully marked in currants . ' Well , I 'll eat it , ' said
Alice , ' and if_it makes me grow larger , I can reach the_key ; and if_it
makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the_door ; so either way I 'll
get into the_garden , and I do n't care which happens ! '

She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' Which_way ? Which
way ? ' , holding her_hand on the_top of her_head to feel which_way it was
growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice
had got so much into the_way of expecting nothing but out - of - the - way
things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the_common_way .

So she set to work , and very soon finished off the_cake .

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *




CHAPTER_II . The_Pool of Tears

' Curiouser and curiouser ! ' cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that
for the_moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ; ' now I 'm
opening out like the_largest_telescope that ever was ! Good - bye , feet ! '
( for when she looked down at her_feet , they seemed to be almost out of
sight , they were getting so far off ) . ' Oh , my_poor_little_feet , I wonder
who will put on your_shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I 'm sure
_ I _ sha n't be able ! I shall be a_great_deal too far off to trouble
myself about you : you must manage the_best_way you can ;-- but I must be
kind to them , ' thought Alice , ' or perhaps they wo n't walk the_way I want
to go ! Let me see : I 'll give them a_new_pair of boots every_Christmas . '

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . ' They must
go by the_carrier , ' she thought ; ' and how funny it 'll seem , sending
presents to one 's own feet ! And how odd the_directions will look !

_ _ _ _ _ ALICE 'S RIGHT_FOOT , ESQ .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ HEARTHRUG ,
<unconvertable> NEAR THE_FENDER ,
<unconvertable> ( WITH ALICE 'S LOVE ) .

Oh_dear , what_nonsense I 'm talking ! '

Just then her_head struck against the_roof of the_hall : in fact she was
now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the_garden_door .

Poor_Alice ! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one_side , to
look through into the_garden with one_eye ; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .

' You ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said Alice , ' a great girl like
you , ' ( she might well say this ) , ' to go on crying in this_way ! Stop this
moment , I tell you ! ' But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of
tears , until there was a_large_pool all round her , about four inches
deep and reaching half down the_hall .

After a_time she heard a_little_pattering of feet in the_distance , and
she hastily dried her_eyes to see what was coming . It was the_White
Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a_pair of white_kid_gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great
hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' Oh ! the Duchess , the Duchess !
Oh ! wo n't she be savage if I 've kept her waiting!'_Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the_Rabbit
came near her , she began , in a_low,_timid_voice , ' If you please , sir-- '
The_Rabbit started violently , dropped the_white_kid_gloves and the_fan ,
and skurried away into the_darkness as hard as he could go .

Alice took up the_fan and gloves , and , as the_hall was very hot , she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ' Dear , dear ! How
queer everything is to - day ! And yesterday_things went on just as usual .
I wonder if I 've been changed in the_night ? Let me think : was I the
same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different . But if I 'm not the same , the_next_question is , Who
in the_world am I ? Ah , THAT 'S the_great_puzzle ! ' And she began thinking
over all_the_children she knew that were of the_same_age as herself , to
see if she could have been changed for any of them .

' I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ' for her_hair goes in such long
ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n't
be Mabel , for I know all_sorts of things , and she , oh ! she knows such a
very little ! Besides , SHE 'S she , and I 'm I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling
it all is ! I 'll try if I know all_the_things I used to know . Let me
see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and
four times seven is -- oh dear ! I shall never get to twenty at that_rate !
However , the_Multiplication_Table does n't signify : let 's try Geography .
London is the_capital of Paris , and Paris is the_capital of Rome , and
Rome -- no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain ! I must have been changed for
Mabel ! I 'll try and say <unconvertable> How doth the_little-- <unconvertable> ' and she crossed her
hands on her_lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it ,
but her_voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the_words did not come the
same as they used to do:--

<unconvertable> ' How doth the_little_crocodile
<unconvertable> Improve his_shining_tail ,
<unconvertable> And pour the_waters of the_Nile
<unconvertable> On every_golden_scale !

<unconvertable> ' How cheerfully he seems to grin ,
<unconvertable> How neatly spread his_claws ,
<unconvertable> And welcome little_fishes in
<unconvertable> With gently smiling jaws ! '

' I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor_Alice , and her_eyes
filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and
I shall have to go and live in that_poky_little_house , and have next to
no_toys to play with , and oh ! ever_so_many_lessons to learn ! No , I 've
made up my_mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! It 'll be no
use their putting their_heads down and saying <unconvertable> Come up again , dear ! <unconvertable> I
shall only look up and say <unconvertable> Who am I then ? Tell me that first , and then ,
if I like being that_person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here
till I 'm somebody else--but , oh dear ! ' cried Alice , with a_sudden_burst
of tears , ' I do wish they WOULD put their_heads down ! I am so VERY tired
of being all alone here ! '

As she said this she looked down at her_hands , and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the_Rabbit's_little_white_kid_gloves while
she was talking . ' How CAN I have done that ? ' she thought . ' I must
be growing small_again . ' She got up and went to the_table to measure
herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now
about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found
out that the_cause of this was the_fan she was holding , and she dropped
it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .

' That WAS a_narrow_escape ! ' said Alice , a good deal frightened at the
sudden_change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and
now for the_garden ! ' and she ran with all_speed back to the_little_door :
but , alas ! the_little_door was shut again , and the_little_golden_key was
lying on the_glass_table as before , ' and things are worse than ever , '
thought the_poor_child , ' for I never was so small as this before , never !
And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! '

As she said these_words her_foot slipped , and in another_moment , splash !
she was up to her_chin in salt_water . Her_first_idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the_sea , ' and in that_case I can go back by
railway , ' she said to herself . ( Alice had been to the_seaside once in
her_life , and had come to the_general_conclusion , that wherever you go
to on the_English_coast you find a_number of bathing_machines in the
sea , some children digging in the_sand with wooden_spades , then a row
of lodging_houses , and behind them a_railway_station . ) However,_she soon
made out that she was in the_pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high .

' I wish I had n't cried so much ! ' said Alice , as she swam about , trying
to find her_way out . ' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by
being drowned in my_own_tears ! That WILL be a_queer_thing , to be sure !
However , everything is queer to - day . '

Just then she heard something splashing about in the_pool a little way
off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought
it must be a_walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small
she was now , and she soon made out that it was only_a_mouse that had
slipped in like herself .

' Would it be of any_use , now , ' thought Alice , ' to speak to this_mouse ?
Everything is so out - of - the - way down here , that I should think very
likely it can talk : at any_rate , there 's no harm in trying . ' So_she
began : ' O Mouse , do you know the_way out of this_pool ? I am very tired
of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ' ( Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a_mouse : she had never done such_a_thing before , but
she remembered having seen in her_brother 's Latin Grammar , ' A_mouse -- of
a_mouse -- to a_mouse -- a_mouse -- O mouse ! ' ) The_Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its_little_eyes ,
but it said nothing .

' Perhaps it does n't understand English , ' thought Alice ; ' I daresay it 's
a_French_mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . ' ( For , with all
her_knowledge of history , Alice had no_very_clear_notion how long ago
anything had happened . ) So she began again : ' Ou_est_ma chatte ? ' which
was the_first_sentence in her_French_lesson - book . The_Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the_water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
' Oh , I beg your_pardon ! ' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt
the_poor_animal's_feelings . ' I quite forgot you did n't like cats . '

' Not like cats ! ' cried the_Mouse , in a_shrill,_passionate_voice . ' Would
YOU like cats if you were me ? '

' Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a_soothing_tone : ' do n't be angry
about it . And yet I wish I could show you our_cat Dinah : I think you 'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . She is such a dear quiet
thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the
pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the_fire , licking her_paws and
washing her_face -- and she is such_a_nice_soft_thing to nurse -- and she 's
such_a_capital_one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your_pardon ! ' cried
Alice again , for this_time the_Mouse was bristling all over , and she
felt certain it must be really offended . ' We wo n't talk about her any
more if you 'd rather not . '

' We indeed ! ' cried the_Mouse , who was trembling down to the_end of his
tail . ' As if I would talk on such_a_subject ! Our_family always HATED
cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! Do n't let me hear the_name again ! '

' I wo n't indeed ! ' said Alice , in a_great_hurry to change the_subject of
conversation . ' Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ? ' The_Mouse did not
answer , so Alice went on eagerly : ' There is such_a_nice_little_dog near
our_house I should like to show you ! A_little_bright - eyed_terrier , you
know , with oh , such_long_curly_brown_hair ! And it 'll fetch things when
you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its_dinner , and all_sorts
of things -- I ca n't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a_farmer ,
you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! He
says it kills all_the_rats and -- oh dear ! ' cried Alice in a_sorrowful
tone , ' I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ' For the_Mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite_a_commotion in
the_pool as it went .

So she called softly after it , ' Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we
wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' When the
Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its
face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ) , and it said in a low
trembling voice , ' Let us get to the_shore , and then I 'll tell you my
history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . '

It was high_time to go , for the_pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a_Duck and a_Dodo ,
a_Lory and an_Eaglet , and several_other_curious_creatures . Alice led the
way , and the_whole_party swam to the_shore .




CHAPTER_III . A_Caucus - Race and a_Long_Tale

They were indeed a_queer - looking_party that assembled on the_bank -- the
birds with draggled_feathers , the animals with their_fur clinging close
to them , and all_dripping_wet , cross , and uncomfortable .

The_first_question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a
consultation about this , and after a_few_minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had
known them all her life . Indeed , she had quite_a_long_argument with the
Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , ' I am older than
you , and must know better ' ; and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was , and , as the_Lory positively refused to tell its
age , there was no more to be said .

At last the_Mouse , who seemed to be a_person of authority among them ,
called out , ' Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! I'LL soon make you
dry_enough ! ' They all sat down at once , in a_large_ring , with the_Mouse
in the_middle . Alice kept her_eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt
sure she would catch a_bad_cold if she did not get dry very soon .

' Ahem ! ' said the_Mouse with an_important_air , ' are you all ready ? This
is the_driest_thing I know . Silence all round , if you please ! <unconvertable> William
the_Conqueror , whose_cause was favoured by the_pope , was soon submitted
to by the_English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest . Edwin and Morcar , the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria-- <unconvertable> '

' Ugh ! ' said the_Lory , with a_shiver .

' I beg your_pardon ! ' said the_Mouse , frowning , but very politely : ' Did
you speak ? '

' Not_I ! ' said the_Lory hastily .

' I thought you did , ' said the_Mouse . ' --I proceed . <unconvertable> Edwin and Morcar ,
the_earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand ,
the_patriotic_archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable-- <unconvertable> '

' Found WHAT ? ' said the_Duck .

' Found IT , ' the_Mouse replied rather crossly : ' of course you know what
<unconvertable> it <unconvertable> means . '

' I know what <unconvertable> it <unconvertable> means well enough , when I find a_thing , ' said the
Duck : ' it 's generally_a_frog or a_worm . The_question is , what did the
archbishop find ? '

The_Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , ' <unconvertable> --found
it advisable to go with Edgar_Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown._William's_conduct at first was moderate . But_the_insolence of his
Normans-- <unconvertable> How are you getting on now , my dear ? ' it continued , turning
to Alice as it spoke .

' As wet as ever , ' said Alice in a_melancholy_tone : ' it does n't seem to
dry me at all . '

' In that_case , ' said the_Dodo solemnly , rising to its_feet , ' I move
that the_meeting adjourn , for the_immediate_adoption of more energetic
remedies-- '

' Speak_English ! ' said the_Eaglet . ' I do n't know the_meaning of half
those_long_words , and , what 's more , I do n't believe you do either ! ' And
the_Eaglet_bent down its_head to hide a_smile : some of the_other_birds
tittered audibly .

' What I was going to say , ' said the_Dodo in an_offended_tone , ' was , that
the_best_thing to get us dry would be a_Caucus - race . '

' What IS a_Caucus - race ? ' said Alice ; not that she wanted much to know ,
but the_Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak ,
and no_one else seemed inclined to say anything .

' Why , ' said the_Dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it . ' ( And , as
you might like to try the_thing yourself , some_winter_day , I will tell
you how the_Dodo managed it . )

First it marked out a_race - course , in a_sort of circle , [ ' the exact
shape does n't matter , ' it said , ) and then all_the_party were placed
along the_course , here and there . There was no ' One , two , three , and
away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they
liked , so that it was not easy to know when the_race was over . However ,
when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again ,
the_Dodo suddenly called out ' The_race is over ! ' and they all crowded
round it , panting , and asking , ' But who has won ? '

This_question the_Dodo could not answer without a_great_deal of thought ,
and it sat for a_long_time with one_finger pressed upon its_forehead
( the_position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the_pictures
of him ) , while the_rest waited in silence . At last the_Dodo said ,
' EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes . '

' But who is to give the_prizes ? ' quite_a_chorus of voices asked .

' Why , SHE , of course , ' said the_Dodo , pointing to Alice with one_finger ;
and the_whole_party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused
way , ' Prizes ! Prizes ! '

Alice had no_idea what to do , and in despair she put her_hand in her
pocket , and pulled out a_box of comfits , ( luckily the_salt_water had
not got into it ) , and handed them round as prizes . There was exactly one
a - piece all round .

' But she must have a_prize herself , you know , ' said the_Mouse .

' Of course , ' the_Dodo replied very gravely . ' What else have you got in
your_pocket ? ' he went on , turning to Alice .

' Only_a_thimble , ' said Alice sadly .

' Hand it over here , ' said the_Dodo .

Then they all crowded round her once more , while the_Dodo solemnly
presented the_thimble , saying ' We beg your_acceptance of this elegant
thimble ' ; and , when it had finished this_short_speech , they all cheered .

Alice thought the_whole_thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything
to say , she simply bowed , and took the_thimble , looking as solemn as she
could .

The_next_thing was to eat the_comfits : this caused some_noise and
confusion , as the_large_birds complained that they could not taste
theirs , and the_small_ones choked and had to be patted on the_back .
However , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a_ring , and
begged the_Mouse to tell them something more .

' You promised to tell me your_history , you_know , ' said Alice , ' and why
it is you hate -- C and D , ' she added in a_whisper , half afraid that it
would be offended again .

' Mine is a long and a_sad_tale ! ' said the_Mouse , turning to Alice , and
sighing .

' It IS a_long_tail , certainly , ' said Alice , looking down with wonder at
the_Mouse's_tail ; ' but why do you call it sad ? ' And she kept on puzzling
about it while the_Mouse was speaking , so that her_idea of the_tale was
something like this:--

<unconvertable> ' Fury said to a
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mouse , That he
<unconvertable> met in the
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ house ,
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> Let us
<unconvertable> both go to
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ law : I will
<unconvertable> prosecute
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ YOU .-- Come ,
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I 'll take no
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ denial ; We
<unconvertable> must have a
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ trial : For
<unconvertable> really this
<unconvertable> morning I 've
_ _ _ _ nothing
<unconvertable> to do . <unconvertable>
<unconvertable> Said the
_ _ _ _ _ _ mouse to the
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ cur , <unconvertable> Such
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a_trial ,
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ dear_Sir ,
<unconvertable> With
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no_jury
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ or_judge ,
<unconvertable> would be
<unconvertable> wasting
<unconvertable> our
_ _ _ _ _ _ breath . <unconvertable>
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> I 'll be
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ judge , I 'll
<unconvertable> be jury , <unconvertable>
<unconvertable> Said
<unconvertable> cunning
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ old_Fury :
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> I 'll
<unconvertable> try the
<unconvertable> whole
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ cause ,
<unconvertable> and
<unconvertable> condemn
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ you
<unconvertable> to
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ death . <unconvertable> '


' You are not attending ! ' said the_Mouse to Alice severely . ' What are you
thinking of ? '

' I beg your_pardon , ' said Alice very humbly : ' you had got to the fifth
bend , I think ? '

' I had NOT ! ' cried the_Mouse , sharply and very angrily .

' A_knot ! ' said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking
anxiously about her . ' Oh , do let me help to undo it ! '

' I shall do nothing of the_sort , ' said the_Mouse , getting up and walking
away . ' You insult me by talking such nonsense ! '

' I did n't mean it ! ' pleaded poor_Alice . ' But you 're so easily offended ,
you know ! '

The_Mouse only growled in reply .

' Please come back and finish your_story!'_Alice called after it ; and the
others all joined in chorus , ' Yes , please do ! ' but the_Mouse only shook
its_head impatiently , and walked a little quicker .

' What a_pity it would n't stay ! ' sighed the_Lory , as soon as it was quite
out of sight ; and an_old_Crab took the_opportunity of saying to her
daughter ' Ah , my dear ! Let this be a_lesson to you never to lose
YOUR_temper ! ' ' Hold your_tongue , Ma ! ' said the_young_Crab , a little
snappishly . ' You 're enough to try the_patience of an oyster ! '

' I wish I had our_Dinah here , I know I do ! ' said Alice aloud , addressing
nobody in particular . ' She 'd soon fetch it back ! '

' And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the_question ? ' said the
Lory .

Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her_pet :
' Dinah 's our_cat . And she 's such_a_capital one for catching mice you
ca n't think ! And oh , I wish you could see her after the_birds ! Why ,
she 'll eat a_little_bird as soon as look at it ! '

This_speech caused a_remarkable_sensation among the_party . Some of the
birds hurried off at once : one old_Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully , remarking , ' I really must be getting home ; the_night - air
does n't suit my_throat ! ' and a_Canary called out in a_trembling_voice to
its_children , ' Come away , my dears ! It 's high_time you were all in bed ! '
On various_pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone .

' I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! ' she said to herself in a melancholy
tone . ' Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I 'm sure she 's the best
cat in the_world ! Oh , my_dear_Dinah ! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more ! ' And here poor_Alice began to cry again , for she felt very
lonely and low - spirited . In a_little_while , however , she again heard
a_little_pattering of footsteps in the_distance , and she looked up
eagerly , half hoping that the_Mouse had changed his_mind , and was coming
back to finish his_story .




CHAPTER_IV . The_Rabbit_Sends in a_Little_Bill

It was the_White_Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking
anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard
it muttering to itself ' The_Duchess ! The_Duchess ! Oh my_dear_paws ! Oh
my_fur and whiskers ! She 'll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are
ferrets ! Where_CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ? ' Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the_fan and the_pair of white_kid_gloves ,
and she very good - naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were
nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her_swim in
the_pool , and the_great_hall , with the_glass_table and the_little_door ,
had vanished completely .

Very soon the_Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and
called out to her in an_angry_tone , ' Why , Mary Ann , what ARE you doing
out here ? Run home this moment , and fetch me a_pair of gloves and a_fan !
Quick , now ! ' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
in the_direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the_mistake it
had made .

' He took me for his housemaid , ' she said to herself as she ran . ' How
surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am ! But I 'd better take him
his_fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them . ' As she said this , she
came upon a_neat_little_house , on the_door of which was a_bright_brass
plate with the_name ' W. RABBIT ' engraved upon it . She went in without
knocking , and hurried_upstairs , in great_fear lest she should meet the
real_Mary_Ann , and be turned out of the_house before she had found the
fan and gloves .

' How queer it seems,'_Alice said to herself , ' to be going messages for
a_rabbit ! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next ! ' And she
began fancying the_sort of thing that would happen : ' <unconvertable> Miss Alice ! Come
here directly , and get ready for your_walk ! <unconvertable> <unconvertable> Coming in a_minute ,
nurse ! But I 've got to see that the_mouse does n't get out . <unconvertable> Only I do n't
think , ' Alice went on , ' that they 'd let Dinah stop in the_house if it
began ordering people about like that ! '

By this_time she had found her_way into a_tidy_little_room with a_table
in the_window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a_fan and two_or_three_pairs
of tiny_white_kid_gloves : she took up the_fan and a_pair of the_gloves ,
and was just going to leave the_room , when her_eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the_looking - glass . There was no_label this time
with the_words ' DRINK_ME , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her_lips . ' I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen , ' she said
to herself , ' whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I 'll just see what
this bottle does . I do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really
I 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! '

It did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had
drunk half_the_bottle , she found her_head pressing against the_ceiling ,
and had to stoop to save her_neck from being broken . She hastily put
down the_bottle , saying to herself ' That 's quite enough -- I hope I sha n't
grow any more -- As it is , I ca n't get out at the_door -- I do wish I had n't
drunk quite so much ! '

Alas ! it was too late to wish that ! She went on growing , and growing ,
and very soon had to kneel down on the_floor : in another_minute there
was not even room for this , and she tried the_effect of lying down with
one_elbow against the_door , and the_other_arm curled round her_head .
Still she went on growing , and , as a_last_resource , she put one_arm out
of the_window , and one_foot up the_chimney , and said to herself ' Now_I
can do no more , whatever happens . What WILL become of me ? '

Luckily for Alice , the_little_magic_bottle had now had its_full_effect ,
and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there
seemed to be no_sort of chance of her ever getting out of the_room
again , no wonder she felt unhappy .

' It was much_pleasanter at home , ' thought poor_Alice , ' when one was n't
always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits . I almost wish I had n't gone down that_rabbit - hole -- and yet -- and
yet -- it 's rather curious , you know , this sort of life ! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me ! When I used to read fairy - tales , I fancied that
kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the_middle of one !
There ought to be a_book written about me , that there ought ! And when I
grow up , I 'll write one -- but I 'm grown up now , ' she added in a_sorrowful
tone ; ' at least there 's no_room to grow up any_more_HERE . '

' But then , ' thought Alice , ' shall I NEVER get any older than I am
now ? That 'll be a_comfort , one way -- never to be an_old_woman -- but
then -- always to have lessons to learn ! Oh , I should n't like THAT ! '

' Oh , you foolish Alice ! ' she answered herself . ' How can you learn
lessons in here ? Why , there 's hardly_room for YOU , and no_room at all
for any_lesson - books ! '

And so she went on , taking first_one_side and then the other , and making
quite_a_conversation of it altogether ; but after a_few_minutes she heard
a_voice outside , and stopped to listen .

' Mary_Ann ! Mary_Ann ! ' said the_voice . ' Fetch me my_gloves this moment ! '
Then came a_little_pattering of feet on the_stairs . Alice knew it was
the_Rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the
house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the_Rabbit , and had no_reason to be afraid of it .

Presently the_Rabbit came up to the_door , and tried to open it ; but , as
the_door opened inwards , and Alice's_elbow was pressed hard against it ,
that_attempt proved a_failure . Alice heard it say to itself ' Then I 'll
go round and get in at the_window . '

' THAT you wo n't ' thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied
she heard the_Rabbit just under the_window , she suddenly spread out her
hand , and made a_snatch in the_air . She did not get hold of anything ,
but she heard a_little_shriek and a_fall , and a_crash of broken_glass ,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber - frame , or something of the_sort .

Next came an_angry_voice -- the Rabbit's--'Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? ' And
then_a_voice she had never heard before , ' Sure then I 'm here ! Digging
for apples , yer honour ! '

' Digging for apples , indeed ! ' said the_Rabbit angrily . ' Here ! Come and
help me out of THIS ! ' ( Sounds of more_broken_glass . )

' Now tell me , Pat , what 's that in the_window ? '

' Sure , it 's an_arm , yer honour ! ' ( He pronounced it ' arrum . ' )

' An_arm , you goose ! Who ever saw one that size ? Why , it fills the whole
window ! '

' Sure , it does , yer honour : but it 's an_arm for all that . '

' Well , it 's got no_business there , at any_rate : go and take it away ! '

There was a_long_silence after this , and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then ; such as , ' Sure , I do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at
all ! ' ' Do as I tell you , you coward ! ' and at last she spread out her
hand again , and made another_snatch in the_air . This time there were
TWO little_shrieks , and more_sounds of broken_glass . ' What a_number of
cucumber - frames there must be ! ' thought Alice . ' I wonder what they 'll do
next ! As for pulling me out of the_window , I only wish they COULD ! I 'm
sure I do n't want to stay in here any_longer ! '

She waited for some_time without hearing anything more : at last came a
rumbling of little_cartwheels , and the_sound of a_good_many_voices
all talking together : she made out the_words : ' Where 's the other
ladder ?-- Why , I had n't to bring but one ; Bill 's got the other -- Bill !
fetch it here , lad!--Here , put 'em up at this_corner -- No , tie 'em
together first -- they do n't reach half high enough yet -- Oh ! they 'll
do well enough ; do n't be particular -- Here , Bill ! catch hold of this
rope -- Will the_roof_bear ?-- Mind that_loose_slate -- Oh , it 's coming
down!_Heads below ! ' ( a loud crash)--'Now , who did that ?-- It was Bill , I
fancy -- Who 's to go down the_chimney ?-- Nay , I sha n't ! YOU do it!--That I
wo n't , then!--Bill 's to go down -- Here , Bill ! the_master says you 're to
go down the_chimney ! '

' Oh ! So Bill 's got to come down the_chimney , has he ? ' said Alice to
herself . ' Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill ! I would n't be in
Bill's_place for a_good_deal : this_fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but
I THINK I can kick a_little ! '

She drew her_foot as far down the_chimney as she could , and waited
till she heard a_little_animal ( she could n't guess of what sort it was )
scratching and scrambling about in the_chimney close above her : then ,
saying to herself ' This is Bill , ' she gave one_sharp_kick , and waited to
see what would happen next .

The_first_thing she heard was a_general_chorus of ' There goes Bill ! '
then_the_Rabbit's_voice along--'Catch him , you by the_hedge ! ' then
silence , and then_another_confusion of voices--'Hold up his_head -- Brandy
now -- Don't choke him -- How was it , old_fellow ? What happened to you ? Tell
us all about it ! '

Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , [ ' That 's Bill , ' thought
Alice , ) ' Well , I hardly know -- No more , thank ye ; I 'm better now -- but I 'm
a_deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is , something comes at me
like a_Jack - in - the - box , and up I goes like a_sky - rocket ! '

' So you did , old_fellow ! ' said the_others .

' We must burn the_house_down ! ' said the_Rabbit's_voice ; and Alice called
out as loud as she could , ' If you do . I 'll set Dinah at you ! '

There was a_dead_silence instantly , and Alice thought to herself , ' I
wonder what they WILL do next ! If they had any_sense , they 'd take the
roof off . ' After a_minute or two , they began moving about again , and
Alice heard the_Rabbit say , ' A_barrowful will do , to begin with . '

' A_barrowful of WHAT ? ' thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt ,
for the_next_moment a_shower of little_pebbles came rattling in at the
window , and some of them hit her in the_face . ' I 'll put a_stop to this , '
she said to herself , and shouted out , ' You 'd better not do that again ! '
which produced another_dead_silence .

Alice noticed with some_surprise that the_pebbles were all turning into
little_cakes as they lay on the_floor , and a_bright_idea came into her
head . ' If I eat one of these_cakes , ' she thought , ' it 's sure to make
SOME_change in my_size ; and as it ca n't possibly make me larger , it must
make me smaller , I suppose . '

So she swallowed one of the_cakes , and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly . As soon as she was small enough to get through
the_door , she ran out of the_house , and found quite_a_crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside . The_poor_little_Lizard , Bill , was
in the_middle , being held up by two_guinea - pigs , who were giving it
something out of a_bottle . They all made a_rush at Alice the moment she
appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself
safe in a_thick_wood .

' The_first_thing I 've got to do , ' said Alice to herself , as she wandered
about in the_wood , ' is to grow to my_right_size again ; and the second
thing is to find my_way into that_lovely_garden . I think that will be
the_best_plan . '

It sounded an_excellent_plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply
arranged ; the_only_difficulty was , that she had not_the_smallest_idea
how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the_trees , a little sharp bark just over her_head made her look up in a
great_hurry .

An_enormous_puppy was looking down at her with large_round_eyes , and
feebly stretching out one_paw , trying to touch her . ' Poor little thing ! '
said Alice , in a_coaxing_tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the_thought that it might be
hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her_coaxing .

Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a_little_bit of stick , and
held it out to the_puppy ; whereupon the_puppy jumped into the_air off
all_its_feet at once , with a_yelp of delight , and rushed at the_stick ,
and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a_great_thistle ,
to keep herself from being run over ; and the_moment she appeared on the
other_side , the_puppy made another_rush at the_stick , and tumbled head
over heels in its_hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was
very like having a_game of play with a_cart - horse , and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its_feet , ran round the_thistle again ; then
the_puppy began a_series of short_charges at the_stick , running a very
little_way_forwards each_time and a_long_way back , and barking hoarsely
all_the_while , till at last it sat down a_good_way off , panting , with
its_tongue hanging out of its_mouth , and its_great_eyes half shut .

This seemed to Alice a_good_opportunity for making her_escape ; so she
set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and
till the_puppy's_bark sounded quite faint in the_distance .

' And yet what_a_dear_little_puppy it was ! ' said Alice , as she leant
against a_buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the
leaves : ' I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if I 'd
only been the_right_size to do it ! Oh dear ! I 'd nearly forgotten that
I 've got to grow up again ! Let me see -- how IS it to be managed ? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great
question is , what ? '

The_great_question certainly was , what ? Alice looked all round her at
the_flowers and the_blades of grass , but she did not see anything that
looked like the_right_thing to eat or drink under the_circumstances .
There was a_large_mushroom growing near her , about the_same_height as
herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both_sides of it , and
behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the_top of it .

She stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the_edge of the
mushroom , and her_eyes immediately met those of a_large_caterpillar ,
that was sitting on the_top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long
hookah , and taking not the_smallest_notice of her or of anything else .




CHAPTER_V._Advice from a_Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some_time in silence :
at last the_Caterpillar took the_hookah out of its_mouth , and addressed
her in a_languid,_sleepy_voice .

' Who are YOU ? ' said the_Caterpillar .

This was not_an_encouraging_opening for a_conversation . Alice replied ,
rather shyly , ' I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been
changed several times since then . '

' What do you mean by that ? ' said the_Caterpillar sternly . ' Explain
yourself ! '

' I ca n't explain MYSELF , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not
myself , you see . '

' I do n't see , ' said the_Caterpillar .

' I 'm afraid I ca n't put it more clearly , ' Alice replied very politely ,
' for I ca n't understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many
different_sizes in a_day is very confusing . '

' It is n't , ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Well , perhaps you_haven't found it so yet , ' said Alice ; ' but when you
have to turn into a_chrysalis -- you will some day , you know -- and then
after that into a_butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little
queer , wo n't you ? '

' Not_a_bit , ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Well , perhaps your_feelings may be different , ' said Alice ; ' all I know
is , it would feel very queer to ME . '

' You ! ' said the_Caterpillar contemptuously . ' Who are YOU ? '

Which brought them back again to the_beginning of the_conversation .
Alice felt a little irritated at the_Caterpillar 's making such VERY
short_remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' I think ,
you ought to tell me who YOU are , first . '

' Why ? ' said the_Caterpillar .

Here was another_puzzling_question ; and as Alice could not think of any
good_reason , and as the_Caterpillar seemed to be in a_VERY unpleasant
state of mind , she turned away .

' Come back ! ' the_Caterpillar called after her . ' I 've something important
to say ! '

This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again .

' Keep your_temper , ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Is_that_all ? ' said Alice , swallowing down her_anger as well as she
could .

' No , ' said the_Caterpillar .

Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its
arms , took the_hookah out of its_mouth again , and said , ' So you think
you 're changed , do you ? '

' I 'm afraid I am , sir , ' said Alice ; ' I ca n't remember things as I
used -- and I do n't keep the_same_size for ten_minutes together ! '

' Ca n't remember WHAT_things ? ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Well , I 've tried to say <unconvertable> HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE , <unconvertable> but it all came
different!'_Alice replied in a_very_melancholy_voice .

' Repeat , <unconvertable> YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , <unconvertable> ' said the_Caterpillar .

Alice folded her_hands , and began:--

<unconvertable> ' You are old , Father William , ' the_young_man said ,
<unconvertable> ' And your_hair has become very white ;
<unconvertable> And yet you incessantly stand on your_head--
<unconvertable> Do you think , at your_age , it is right ? '

<unconvertable> ' In my youth , ' Father_William replied to his_son ,
<unconvertable> ' I feared it might injure the_brain ;
<unconvertable> But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none ,
<unconvertable> Why , I do it again and again . '

<unconvertable> ' You are old , ' said the_youth , ' as I mentioned before ,
<unconvertable> And have grown most uncommonly fat ;
<unconvertable> Yet you turned a_back - somersault in at the_door--
<unconvertable> Pray , what is the_reason of that ? '

<unconvertable> ' In my_youth , ' said the_sage , as he shook his_grey_locks ,
<unconvertable> ' I kept all_my_limbs very supple
<unconvertable> By the_use of this_ointment -- one shilling the_box--
<unconvertable> Allow me to sell you a_couple ? '

<unconvertable> ' You are old , ' said the_youth , ' and your_jaws are too weak
<unconvertable> For anything tougher than suet ;
<unconvertable> Yet you finished the_goose , with the_bones and the_beak--
<unconvertable> Pray how did you manage to do it ? '

<unconvertable> ' In my_youth , ' said his_father , ' I took to the_law ,
<unconvertable> And argued each_case with my_wife ;
<unconvertable> And the_muscular_strength , which it gave to my_jaw ,
<unconvertable> Has lasted the_rest of my_life . '

<unconvertable> ' You are old , ' said the_youth , ' one would hardly suppose
_ _ _ _ That_your_eye was as steady as ever ;
<unconvertable> Yet you balanced an_eel on the_end of your_nose--
_ _ _ _ What made you so awfully clever ? '

<unconvertable> ' I have answered three_questions , and that is enough , '
<unconvertable> Said his_father ; ' do n't give yourself airs !
<unconvertable> Do you think I can listen all day to such_stuff ?
<unconvertable> Be off , or I 'll kick you down stairs ! '


' That is not said right , ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Not QUITE right , I'm_afraid , ' said Alice , timidly ; ' some of the_words
have got altered . '

' It is wrong from beginning to end , ' said the_Caterpillar decidedly , and
there was silence for some_minutes .

The_Caterpillar was the first to speak .

' What_size do you want to be ? ' it asked .

' Oh , I 'm not particular as to size,'_Alice hastily replied ; ' only one
does n't like changing so often , you know . '

' I DON'T know , ' said the_Caterpillar .

Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her_life
before , and she felt that she was losing her_temper .

' Are you content_now ? ' said the_Caterpillar .

' Well , I should like to be a LITTLE larger , sir , if you would n't mind , '
said Alice : ' three inches is such_a_wretched_height to be . '

' It is a_very_good_height indeed ! ' said the_Caterpillar angrily , rearing
itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) .

' But I 'm not used to it ! ' pleaded poor_Alice in a_piteous_tone . And
she thought of herself , ' I wish the_creatures would n't be so easily
offended ! '

' You 'll get used to it in time , ' said the_Caterpillar ; and it put the
hookah into its_mouth and began smoking again .

This_time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again . In
a minute or two the_Caterpillar took the_hookah out of its_mouth
and yawned once or twice , and shook itself . Then it got down off the
mushroom , and crawled away in the_grass , merely remarking as it went ,
' One_side will make you grow taller , and the_other_side will make you
grow shorter . '

' One side of WHAT ? The_other_side of WHAT ? ' thought Alice to herself .

' Of the_mushroom , ' said the_Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it
aloud ; and in another_moment it was out of sight .

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the_mushroom for a_minute , trying
to make out which were the_two_sides of it ; and as it was perfectly
round , she found this_a_very_difficult_question . However,_at_last_she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a_bit
of the_edge with each_hand .

' And now which is which ? ' she said to herself , and nibbled a_little of
the_right - hand_bit to try the_effect : the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her_chin : it had struck her_foot !

She was a_good_deal frightened by this_very_sudden_change , but she felt
that there was no_time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so_she
set to work at once to eat some of the_other_bit . Her_chin was pressed
so closely against her_foot , that there was hardly_room to open her
mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a_morsel of the
lefthand_bit .


<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

<unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> * <unconvertable> *

' Come , my_head 's free at last ! ' said Alice in a_tone of delight , which
changed into alarm in another_moment , when she found that her_shoulders
were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was
an_immense_length of neck , which seemed to rise like a_stalk out of a
sea of green_leaves that lay far below her .

' What CAN all_that_green_stuff_be ? ' said Alice . ' And where HAVE my
shoulders got to ? And oh , my_poor_hands , how is it I ca n't see you ? '
She was moving them about as she spoke , but no_result seemed to follow ,
except a_little_shaking among the_distant_green_leaves .

As there seemed to be no_chance of getting her_hands up to her_head , she
tried to get her_head down to them , and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any_direction , like a_serpent . She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a_graceful_zigzag , and was going
to dive in among the_leaves , which she found to be nothing but the_tops
of the_trees under which she had been wandering , when a_sharp_hiss made
her_draw back in a_hurry : a_large_pigeon had flown into her_face , and
was beating her violently with its_wings .

' Serpent ! ' screamed the_Pigeon .

' I 'm NOT_a_serpent ! ' said Alice indignantly . ' Let me alone ! '

' Serpent , I say again ! ' repeated the_Pigeon , but in a_more_subdued_tone ,
and added with a_kind of sob , ' I 've tried every way , and nothing seems
to suit them ! '

' I haven't the_least_idea what you 're talking about , ' said Alice .

' I 've tried the_roots of trees , and I 've tried_banks , and I 've tried
hedges , ' the_Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; ' but those
serpents ! There 's no_pleasing_them ! '

Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no_use in
saying anything more till the_Pigeon had finished .

' As if it wasn't_trouble enough_hatching the_eggs , ' said the_Pigeon ;
' but I must be on the_look - out for serpents night and day ! Why,_I
haven't had a_wink of sleep these_three_weeks ! '

' I 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said Alice , who was beginning to
see its meaning .

' And just as I 'd taken the_highest_tree in the_wood , ' continued the
Pigeon , raising its_voice to a_shriek , ' and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from
the_sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! '

' But I 'm NOT_a_serpent , I tell you ! ' said Alice . ' I 'm a -- I'm a-- '

' Well ! WHAT are you ? ' said the_Pigeon . ' I can see you 're trying to
invent something ! '

' I -- I'm a little girl , ' said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered
the_number of changes she had gone through that_day .

' A_likely_story_indeed ! ' said the_Pigeon in a_tone of the deepest
contempt . ' I 've seen a_good_many_little_girls in my_time , but never ONE
with such_a_neck as that ! No , no ! You 're a_serpent ; and there 's no_use
denying it . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg ! '

' I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly , ' said Alice , who was a very truthful
child ; ' but little_girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you
know . '

' I do n't believe it , ' said the_Pigeon ; ' but if they do , why then they 're
a_kind of serpent , that 's all I can say . '

This was such_a_new_idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a
minute or two , which gave the_Pigeon the_opportunity of adding , ' You 're
looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me
whether you 're a_little_girl or a_serpent ? '

' It matters a_good_deal to ME , ' said Alice hastily ; ' but I 'm not looking
for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I should n't want YOURS : I do n't
like_them raw . '

' Well , be off , then ! ' said the_Pigeon in a_sulky_tone , as it settled
down again into its_nest . Alice crouched down among the_trees as well as
she could , for her_neck kept getting entangled among the_branches , and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After a_while she
remembered that she still held the_pieces of mushroom in her_hands , and
she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the
other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her_usual_height .

It was so long since she had been anything near the_right_size , that it
felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a_few_minutes ,
and began talking to herself , as usual . ' Come , there 's half my_plan done
now ! How puzzling all_these_changes are ! I 'm never sure what I 'm going
to be , from one_minute to another ! However , I 've got back to my right
size : the_next_thing is , to get into that_beautiful_garden -- how IS that
to be done , I wonder ? ' As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open
place , with a_little_house in it about four feet high . ' Whoever lives
there , ' thought Alice , ' it 'll never do to come upon them THIS_size : why ,
I should frighten them out of their_wits ! ' So she began nibbling at the
righthand bit again , and did_not_venture to go near the_house till she
had brought herself down to nine inches high .




CHAPTER_VI . Pig and Pepper

For a minute or two she stood looking at the_house , and wondering what
to do next , when suddenly_a_footman in livery came running out of the
wood--(she considered him to be a_footman because he was in livery :
otherwise , judging by his_face only , she would have called him a
fish)--and rapped loudly at the_door with his_knuckles . It was opened
by another_footman in livery , with a_round_face , and large_eyes like a
frog ; and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered_hair that curled all
over their_heads . She felt very curious to know what it was all about ,
and crept a_little_way out of the_wood to listen .

The_Fish - Footman began by producing from under his_arm a great letter ,
nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other ,
saying , in a_solemn_tone , ' For the_Duchess . An_invitation from the_Queen
to play croquet . ' The_Frog - Footman repeated , in the_same_solemn_tone ,
only changing the_order of the_words a little , ' From the_Queen . An
invitation for the_Duchess to play croquet . '

Then they both bowed low , and their_curls got entangled together .

Alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the
Fish - Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the_ground near the
door , staring stupidly up into the_sky .

Alice went timidly up to the_door , and knocked .

' There 's no_sort of use in knocking , ' said the_Footman , ' and that for
two_reasons . First , because I 'm on the_same_side of the_door as you
are ; secondly , because they 're making such_a_noise inside , no_one could
possibly hear you . ' And certainly there was a_most_extraordinary_noise
going on within -- a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then
a_great_crash , as if a_dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .

' Please , then , ' said Alice , ' how am I to get in ? '

' There might be some_sense in your_knocking , ' the_Footman went on
without attending to her , ' if we had the_door between us . For instance ,
if you were INSIDE , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know . '
He was looking up into the_sky all the time he was speaking , and this
Alice thought decidedly uncivil . ' But perhaps he ca n't help it , ' she
said to herself ; ' his_eyes are so VERY nearly at the_top of his_head .
But at any_rate he might answer questions .-- How am I to get in ? ' she
repeated , aloud .

' I shall sit here , ' the_Footman remarked , ' till tomorrow-- '

At this_moment the_door of the_house opened , and a_large_plate came
skimming out , straight at the_Footman's_head : it just grazed his_nose ,
and broke to pieces against one of the_trees behind him .

' --or next day , maybe , ' the_Footman continued in the_same_tone , exactly
as if nothing had happened .

' How am I to get in ? ' asked Alice again , in a_louder_tone .

' ARE you to get in at all ? ' said the_Footman . ' That 's the first
question , you know . '

It was , no doubt : only_Alice did not like to be told so . ' It 's really
dreadful , ' she muttered to herself , ' the way all_the_creatures argue .
It 's enough to drive one_crazy ! '

The_Footman seemed to think this_a_good_opportunity for repeating his
remark , with variations . ' I shall sit here , ' he said , ' on and off , for
days and days . '

' But what am I to do ? ' said Alice .

' Anything_you like , ' said the_Footman , and began whistling .

' Oh , there 's no_use in talking to him , ' said Alice desperately : ' he 's
perfectly idiotic ! ' And she opened the_door and went in .

The_door led right into a_large_kitchen , which was full of smoke from
one_end to the other : the_Duchess was sitting on a_three - legged_stool in
the_middle , nursing a_baby ; the_cook was leaning over the_fire , stirring
a_large_cauldron which seemed to be full of soup .

' There 's certainly_too_much_pepper in that_soup ! ' Alice said to herself ,
as well as she could for sneezing .

There was certainly too much of it in the_air . Even_the_Duchess
sneezed occasionally ; and as for the_baby , it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a_moment's_pause . The_only_things in the_kitchen
that_did_not_sneeze , were the_cook , and a_large_cat which was sitting on
the_hearth and grinning from ear to ear .

' Please would you tell me , ' said Alice , a little timidly , for she was
not quite sure whether it was good_manners for her to speak first , ' why
your cat grins like that ? '

' It 's a_Cheshire_cat , ' said the_Duchess , ' and that 's why . Pig ! '

She said the_last_word with such_sudden_violence that Alice quite
jumped ; but she saw in another_moment that it was addressed to the_baby ,
and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again:--

' I did n't know that Cheshire_cats always grinned ; in fact , I did n't know
that_cats_COULD grin . '

' They all can , ' said the_Duchess ; ' and most of 'em do . '

' I do n't know of any that do,'_Alice said very politely , feeling quite
pleased to have got into a_conversation .

' You do n't know much , ' said the_Duchess ; ' and that 's a_fact . '

Alice did not at all like the_tone of this_remark , and thought it would
be as well to introduce some_other_subject of conversation . While_she
was trying to fix on one , the_cook took the_cauldron of soup off the
fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her_reach at
the_Duchess and the_baby -- the_fire - irons came first ; then followed a
shower of saucepans , plates , and dishes . The_Duchess took no_notice of
them even when they hit her ; and the_baby was howling so much already ,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the_blows hurt it or not .

' Oh , PLEASE mind what you 're doing ! ' cried Alice , jumping up and down in
an_agony of terror . ' Oh , there goes his_PRECIOUS_nose ' ; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly carried it off .

' If everybody minded their_own_business , ' the_Duchess said in a hoarse
growl , ' the_world would go round a_deal faster than it does . '

' Which would NOT be an_advantage , ' said Alice , who felt very glad to get
an_opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge . ' Just think of
what_work it would make with the_day and night ! You see the_earth takes
twenty - four_hours to turn round on its_axis-- '

' Talking of axes , ' said the_Duchess , ' chop off her_head ! '

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the_cook , to see if she meant to take
the_hint ; but the_cook was busily stirring the_soup , and seemed not to
be listening , so she went on again : ' Twenty - four_hours , I THINK ; or is
it twelve ? I-- '

' Oh , do n't bother ME , ' said the_Duchess ; ' I never could abide figures ! '
And with that she began nursing her_child again , singing a_sort of
lullaby to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the_end of
every_line :

<unconvertable> ' Speak roughly to your_little_boy ,
<unconvertable> And beat him when he sneezes :
_ _ _ He only does it to annoy ,
<unconvertable> Because he knows it teases . '

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CHORUS .

<unconvertable> ( In which the_cook and the_baby joined):--

<unconvertable> ' Wow ! wow ! wow ! '

While the_Duchess sang the_second_verse of the_song , she kept tossing
the_baby violently up and down , and the_poor_little_thing howled so ,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

<unconvertable> ' I speak severely to my_boy ,
_ _ _ _ I beat him when he sneezes ;
<unconvertable> For he can thoroughly enjoy
_ _ _ _ The_pepper when he pleases ! '

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CHORUS .

<unconvertable> ' Wow ! wow ! wow ! '

' Here ! you may nurse it a bit , if you like ! ' the_Duchess said to Alice ,
flinging the_baby at her as she spoke . ' I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the_Queen , ' and she hurried out of the_room . The_cook threw
a_frying - pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her .

Alice caught the_baby with some_difficulty , as it was a queer - shaped
little_creature , and held out its_arms and legs in all_directions , ' just
like a_star - fish , ' thought Alice . The_poor_little_thing was snorting
like a_steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the_first_minute
or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .

As soon as she had made out the_proper_way of nursing it , ( which was to
twist it up into a_sort of knot , and then keep tight_hold of its right
ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , ) she carried
it out into the_open_air . ' IF I do n't take this_child away with me , '
thought Alice , ' they 're sure to kill it in a_day or two : wouldn't_it be
murder to leave it behind ? ' She said the_last_words out loud , and the
little_thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this_time ) .
' Don't_grunt , ' said Alice ; ' that 's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself . '

The_baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its_face to
see what was the_matter with it . There could be no_doubt that it had
a_VERY_turn - up_nose , much more like a_snout than a_real_nose ; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a_baby : altogether Alice did not
like the_look of the_thing at all . ' But perhaps it was only sobbing , '
she thought , and looked into its_eyes again , to see if there were any
tears .

No , there were no_tears . ' If you 're going to turn into a_pig , my dear , '
said Alice , seriously , ' I 'll have nothing more to do with you . Mind
now ! ' The_poor_little_thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible
to say which ) , and they went on for some_while in silence .

Alice was just beginning to think to herself , ' Now , what am I to do with
this_creature when I get it home ? ' when it grunted again , so violently ,
that she looked down into its_face in some_alarm . This time there could
be NO_mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a_pig , and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further .

So she set the_little_creature down , and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the_wood . ' If it had grown up , ' she said
to herself , ' it would have made a_dreadfully_ugly_child : but it makes
rather a_handsome_pig , I think . ' And she began thinking over other
children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying
to herself , ' if one only knew the_right_way to change them-- ' when she
was a_little startled by seeing the_Cheshire_Cat sitting on a_bough of a
tree a few yards off .

The_Cat only grinned when it saw Alice . It looked good - natured , she
thought : still it had VERY long_claws and a_great_many_teeth , so_she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect .

' Cheshire_Puss , ' she began , rather timidly , as she did not at all know
whether it would like the_name : however , it only grinned a little wider .
' Come , it 's pleased so far , ' thought Alice , and she went on . ' Would you
tell me , please , which_way I ought to go from here ? '

' That depends a_good_deal on where you want to get to , ' said the_Cat .

' I do n't much care where-- ' said Alice .

' Then it does n't matter which way you go , ' said the_Cat .

' --so long as I get SOMEWHERE,'_Alice added as an_explanation .

' Oh , you 're sure to do that , ' said the_Cat , ' if you only walk long
enough . '

Alice felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another_question .
' What_sort of people live about here ? '

' In THAT_direction , ' the_Cat said , waving its right paw round , ' lives
a_Hatter : and in THAT_direction , ' waving the_other_paw , ' lives a_March
Hare . Visit either you like : they 're both mad . '

' But I do n't want to go among mad_people , ' Alice remarked .

' Oh , you ca n't help that , ' said the_Cat : ' we 're all mad here . I 'm mad .
You 're mad . '

' How do you know I 'm mad ? ' said Alice .

' You must be , ' said the_Cat , ' or you would n't have come here . '

Alice did n't think that proved it at all ; however , she went on ' And how
do you know that you 're mad ? '

' To begin with , ' said the_Cat , ' a_dog 's not mad . You grant that ? '

' I suppose so , ' said Alice .

' Well , then , ' the_Cat went on , ' you see , a_dog growls when it 's angry ,
and wags its_tail when it 's pleased . Now I growl when I 'm pleased , and
wag my_tail when I 'm angry . Therefore I 'm mad . '

' I call it purring , not_growling , ' said Alice .

' Call it what you like , ' said the_Cat . ' Do you play croquet with the
Queen to - day ? '

' I should like it very much , ' said Alice , ' but I haven't been invited
yet . '

' You 'll see me there , ' said the_Cat , and vanished .

Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer
things happening . While she was looking at the_place where it had been ,
it suddenly appeared again .

' By - the - bye , what_became of the_baby ? ' said the_Cat . ' I 'd nearly
forgotten to ask . '

' It turned into a_pig , ' Alice quietly said , just as if it had come back
in a_natural_way .

' I thought it would , ' said the_Cat , and vanished again .

Alice waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not
appear , and after a_minute or two she walked on in the_direction in
which the_March_Hare was said to live . ' I 've seen hatters before , ' she
said to herself ; ' the_March_Hare will be much the most interesting , and
perhaps as this is May it wo n't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as
it was in March . ' As she said this , she looked up , and there was the_Cat
again , sitting on a_branch of a_tree .

' Did you say pig , or fig ? ' said the_Cat .

' I said pig , ' replied Alice ; ' and I wish you would n't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly : you make one_quite_giddy . '

' All_right , ' said the_Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly ,
beginning with the_end of the_tail , and ending with the_grin , which
remained some time after the_rest of it had gone .

' Well ! I 've often seen a_cat without a_grin,'_thought Alice ; ' but a_grin
without a_cat ! It 's the_most_curious_thing I ever saw in my_life ! '

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the_house
of the_March_Hare : she thought it must be the_right_house , because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the_roof was thatched with fur . It
was so large a_house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the_lefthand_bit of mushroom , and raised herself to
about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly ,
saying to herself ' Suppose it should be raving mad after all ! I almost
wish I 'd gone to see the_Hatter_instead ! '




CHAPTER_VII . A_Mad_Tea - Party

There was a_table set out under a_tree in front of the_house , and the
March_Hare and the_Hatter were having tea at it : a_Dormouse was sitting
between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a
cushion , resting their_elbows on it , and talking over its_head . ' Very
uncomfortable for the_Dormouse , ' thought Alice ; ' only , as it 's asleep , I
suppose it does n't mind . '

The_table was a_large_one , but the three were all crowded together at
one_corner of it : ' No_room ! No_room ! ' they cried out when they saw Alice
coming . ' There 's PLENTY of room ! ' said Alice indignantly , and she sat
down in a_large_arm - chair at one_end of the_table .

' Have some wine , ' the_March_Hare said in an_encouraging_tone .

Alice looked all round the_table , but there was nothing on it but tea .
' I do n't see any_wine , ' she remarked .

' There isn't_any , ' said the_March_Hare .

' Then it was n't very civil of you to offer it , ' said Alice angrily .

' It was n't very civil of you to sit down without being invited , ' said
the_March_Hare .

' I did n't know it was YOUR_table , ' said Alice ; ' it 's laid for a great
many more than three . '

' Your_hair wants cutting , ' said the_Hatter . He had been looking at Alice
for some_time with great_curiosity , and this was his_first_speech .

' You should learn not to make personal_remarks,'_Alice said with some
severity ; ' it 's very rude . '

The_Hatter opened his_eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he SAID
was , ' Why is a_raven like a_writing - desk ? '

' Come , we shall have some_fun now ! ' thought Alice . ' I 'm glad they 've
begun asking riddles .-- I believe I can guess that , ' she added aloud .

' Do you mean that you think you can find out the_answer to it ? ' said the
March_Hare .

' Exactly so , ' said Alice .

' Then you should say what you mean , ' the_March_Hare went on .

' I do , ' Alice hastily replied ; ' at least -- at least I mean what I
say -- that 's the same thing , you know . '

' Not_the_same_thing a_bit ! ' said the_Hatter . ' You might just as well say
that <unconvertable> I see what I eat <unconvertable> is the_same_thing as <unconvertable> I eat what I see <unconvertable> ! '

' You might just as well say , ' added the_March_Hare , ' that <unconvertable> I like what I
get <unconvertable> is the_same_thing as <unconvertable> I get what I like <unconvertable> ! '

' You might just as well say , ' added the_Dormouse , who seemed to be
talking in his_sleep , ' that <unconvertable> I breathe when I sleep <unconvertable> is the_same_thing
as <unconvertable> I sleep when I breathe <unconvertable> ! '

' It IS the_same_thing with you , ' said the_Hatter , and here the
conversation dropped , and the_party sat silent for a_minute , while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing - desks ,
which was n't much .

The_Hatter was the first to break the_silence . ' What_day of the_month
is it ? ' he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his_watch out of his
pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then ,
and holding it to his_ear .

Alice considered a little , and then said ' The fourth . '

' Two days wrong ! ' sighed the_Hatter . ' I told you butter would n't suit
the_works ! ' he added looking angrily at the_March_Hare .

' It was the_BEST_butter , ' the_March_Hare meekly replied .

' Yes , but some_crumbs must have got in as well , ' the_Hatter grumbled :
' you should n't have put it in with the_bread - knife . '

The_March_Hare took the_watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped
it into his_cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of
nothing better to say than his_first_remark , ' It was the_BEST_butter ,
you know . '

Alice had been looking over his_shoulder with some_curiosity . ' What a
funny watch ! ' she remarked . ' It tells the_day of the_month , and does n't
tell what_o'clock it is ! '

' Why should it ? ' muttered the_Hatter . ' Does YOUR_watch tell you what
year it is ? '

' Of course not , ' Alice replied very readily : ' but that 's because it
stays the_same_year for such_a_long_time together . '

' Which is just_the_case with MINE , ' said the_Hatter .

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled . The_Hatter's_remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly_English . ' I do n't quite
understand you , ' she said , as politely as she could .

' The_Dormouse is asleep_again , ' said the_Hatter , and he poured a little
hot_tea upon its_nose .

The_Dormouse shook its_head impatiently , and said , without opening its
eyes , ' Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself . '

' Have you guessed the_riddle yet ? ' the_Hatter said , turning to Alice
again .

' No , I give it up , ' Alice replied : ' what 's the_answer ? '

' I haven't the_slightest_idea , ' said the_Hatter .

' Nor I , ' said the_March_Hare .

Alice sighed wearily . ' I think you might do something better with the
time , ' she said , ' than waste it in asking riddles that have no_answers . '

' If you knew Time as well as I do , ' said the_Hatter , ' you would n't talk
about wasting IT . It 's HIM . '

' I do n't know what you mean , ' said Alice .

' Of course you do n't ! ' the_Hatter said , tossing his_head contemptuously .
' I dare say you never even spoke to Time ! '

' Perhaps not , ' Alice cautiously replied : ' but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music . '

' Ah ! that accounts for it , ' said the_Hatter . ' He wo n't stand beating .
Now , if you only kept on good_terms with him , he 'd do almost_anything
you liked with the_clock . For instance , suppose it were nine o'clock in
the_morning , just time to begin lessons : you 'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time , and round goes the_clock in a_twinkling ! Half - past one ,
time for dinner ! '

[ ' I only wish it was , ' the_March_Hare said to itself in a_whisper . )

' That would be grand , certainly , ' said Alice thoughtfully : ' but then -- I
should n't be hungry for it , you know . '

' Not at first , perhaps , ' said the_Hatter : ' but you could keep it to
half - past one as long as you liked . '

' Is that the_way YOU manage ? ' Alice asked .

The_Hatter shook his_head mournfully . ' Not I ! ' he replied . ' We
quarrelled last March -- just before HE went mad , you know-- ' ( pointing
with his_tea_spoon at the_March_Hare , ) ' --it was at the_great_concert
given by the_Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing

_ _ _ _ _ <unconvertable> Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
<unconvertable> How I wonder what you 're at ! <unconvertable>

You know the_song , perhaps ? '

' I 've heard something like it , ' said Alice .

' It goes on , you know , ' the_Hatter continued , ' in this_way:--

<unconvertable> <unconvertable> Up above the_world you fly ,
<unconvertable> Like a_tea - tray in the_sky .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Twinkle , twinkle-- <unconvertable> '

Here the_Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its_sleep ' Twinkle ,
twinkle , twinkle , twinkle-- ' and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop .

' Well , I 'd hardly finished the_first_verse , ' said the_Hatter , ' when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out , <unconvertable> He 's murdering the_time ! Off with his
head ! <unconvertable> '

' How dreadfully savage ! ' exclaimed Alice .

' And ever since that , ' the_Hatter went on in a_mournful_tone , ' he wo n't
do a_thing I ask ! It 's always six o'clock now . '

A_bright_idea came into Alice's_head . ' Is that the_reason so many
tea - things are put out here ? ' she asked .

' Yes , that's_it , ' said the_Hatter with a_sigh : ' it 's always_tea - time ,
and we 've no_time to wash the_things between whiles . '

' Then you keep moving round , I suppose ? ' said Alice .

' Exactly so , ' said the_Hatter : ' as the_things get used up . '

' But what happens when you come to the_beginning again ? ' Alice ventured
to ask .

' Suppose we change the_subject , ' the March_Hare interrupted , yawning .
' I 'm getting tired of this . I vote the_young_lady tells us a_story . '

' I 'm afraid I do n't know one , ' said Alice , rather alarmed at the
proposal .

' Then the Dormouse shall ! ' they both cried . ' Wake up , Dormouse ! ' And
they pinched it on both_sides at once .

The Dormouse slowly opened his_eyes . ' I was n't asleep , ' he said in a
hoarse,_feeble_voice : ' I heard every_word you fellows were saying . '

' Tell us a_story ! ' said the_March_Hare .

' Yes , please do ! ' pleaded_Alice .

' And be quick about it , ' added the_Hatter , ' or you 'll be asleep again
before it 's done . '

' Once upon a_time there were three_little_sisters , ' the_Dormouse began
in a_great_hurry ; ' and their_names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie ; and
they lived at the_bottom of a_well-- '

' What did they live on ? ' said Alice , who always took a_great_interest in
questions of eating and drinking .

' They lived on treacle , ' said the_Dormouse , after thinking a_minute or
two .

' They could n't have done that , you know , ' Alice gently remarked ; ' they 'd
have been ill . '

' So they were , ' said the_Dormouse ; ' VERY ill . '

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : ' But
why did they live at the_bottom of a_well ? '

' Take some more tea , ' the_March_Hare said to Alice , very earnestly .

' I 've had nothing yet , ' Alice replied in an_offended_tone , ' so I ca n't
take more . '

' You mean you ca n't take LESS , ' said the_Hatter : ' it 's very easy to take
MORE than nothing . '

' Nobody asked YOUR_opinion , ' said Alice .

' Who 's making personal_remarks now ? ' the_Hatter asked triumphantly .

Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself
to some_tea and bread - and - butter , and then turned to the_Dormouse , and
repeated her_question . ' Why did they live at the_bottom of a_well ? '

The_Dormouse again took a_minute or two to think about it , and then
said , ' It was a_treacle - well . '

' There 's no_such_thing ! ' Alice was beginning very angrily , but the
Hatter and the_March_Hare went ' Sh ! sh ! ' and the_Dormouse sulkily
remarked , ' If you ca n't be civil , you 'd better finish the_story for
yourself . '

' No , please go on ! ' Alice said very humbly ; ' I wo n't interrupt again . I
dare say there may be ONE . '

' One , indeed ! ' said the_Dormouse indignantly . However , he consented to
go on . ' And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw ,
you know-- '

' What did they draw ? ' said Alice , quite forgetting her_promise .

' Treacle , ' said the_Dormouse , without considering at all_this_time .

' I want a_clean_cup , ' interrupted the_Hatter : ' let 's all move one_place
on . '

He moved on as he spoke , and the_Dormouse followed him : the March Hare
moved into the_Dormouse's_place , and Alice rather unwillingly took
the_place of the_March_Hare . The_Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the_change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before , as the_March_Hare had just upset the_milk - jug into his_plate .

Alice did not wish to offend the_Dormouse again , so she began very
cautiously : ' But I do n't understand . Where did they draw the_treacle
from ? '

' You can draw water out of a_water - well , ' said the_Hatter ; ' so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle - well -- eh , stupid ? '

' But they were IN the_well , ' Alice said to the_Dormouse , not choosing to
notice this_last_remark .

' Of course they were ' , said the_Dormouse ; ' --well in . '

This_answer so confused poor_Alice , that she let the_Dormouse go on for
some_time without interrupting it .

' They were learning to draw , ' the_Dormouse went on , yawning and rubbing
its_eyes , for it was getting very sleepy ; ' and they drew all_manner of
things -- everything that begins with an_M-- '

' Why with an_M ? ' said Alice .

' Why not ? ' said the_March_Hare .

Alice was silent .

The_Dormouse had closed its_eyes by this_time , and was going off into
a doze ; but , on being pinched by the_Hatter , it woke up again with
a_little_shriek , and went on : ' --that begins with an_M , such as
mouse - traps , and the_moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say
things are <unconvertable> much of a_muchness--did you ever see such_a_thing as a
drawing of a_muchness ? '

' Really , now you ask me , ' said Alice , very much confused , ' I do n't
think-- '

' Then you should n't talk , ' said the_Hatter .

This_piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in
great_disgust , and walked off ; the_Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and
neither of the_others took the_least_notice of her going , though she
looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her :
the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the_Dormouse into
the_teapot .

' At any_rate I 'll never go THERE again ! ' said Alice as she picked her
way through the_wood . ' It 's the_stupidest_tea - party I ever was at in all
my_life ! '

Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the_trees had a_door
leading right into it . ' That 's very curious ! ' she thought . ' But
everything 's curious today . I think I may as well go in at once . ' And in
she went .

Once more she found herself in the_long_hall , and close to the little
glass_table . ' Now , I 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself ,
and began by taking the_little_golden_key , and unlocking the_door that
led into the_garden . Then she went to work nibbling at the_mushroom ( she
had kept a_piece of it in her_pocket ) till she was about a foot high :
then she walked down the_little_passage : and THEN -- she found herself at
last in the_beautiful_garden , among the_bright_flower - beds and the cool
fountains .




CHAPTER_VIII . The_Queen 's Croquet - Ground

A_large_rose - tree stood near the_entrance of the_garden : the roses
growing on it were white , but there were three_gardeners at it , busily
painting them red . Alice thought this_a_very_curious_thing , and she went
nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of
them say , ' Look out now , Five ! Do n't go splashing paint over me like
that ! '

' I could n't help it , ' said Five , in a_sulky_tone ; ' Seven jogged my
elbow . '

On which Seven looked up and said , ' That 's right , Five ! Always lay the
blame on others ! '

' YOU'D better not talk ! ' said Five . ' I heard the_Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! '

' What_for ? ' said the_one who had spoken first .

' That 's none of YOUR_business , Two ! ' said Seven .

' Yes , it IS his_business ! ' said Five , ' and I 'll tell him -- it was for
bringing the_cook tulip - roots instead of onions . '

Seven flung down his_brush , and had just begun ' Well , of all the unjust
things-- ' when his_eye chanced to fall upon Alice , as she stood watching
them , and he checked himself suddenly : the_others looked round also , and
all of them bowed low .

' Would you tell me , ' said Alice , a little timidly , ' why you are painting
those roses ? '

Five and Seven said nothing , but looked at Two . Two began in a low
voice , ' Why the_fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a
RED rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if_the_Queen
was to find it out , we should all have our_heads cut off , you know .
So you see , Miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' At this
moment Five , who had been anxiously looking across the_garden , called
out ' The_Queen ! The_Queen ! ' and the_three_gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their_faces . There was a_sound of many_footsteps ,
and Alice looked round , eager to see the_Queen .

First came ten_soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like
the_three_gardeners , oblong and flat , with their_hands and feet at the
corners : next the_ten_courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds , and walked two and two , as the_soldiers did . After these came
the_royal_children ; there were ten of them , and the_little_dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented
with hearts . Next came the_guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among
them Alice recognised the_White_Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried
nervous_manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without
noticing her . Then followed the_Knave of Hearts , carrying the_King 's
crown on a_crimson_velvet_cushion ; and , last of all this grand
procession , came THE_KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS .

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her_face
like the_three_gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard
of such_a_rule at processions ; ' and besides , what would be the_use of
a_procession,'_thought_she , ' if people had all to lie down upon their
faces , so that they could n't see it ? ' So she stood still where she was ,
and waited .

When the_procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked
at her , and the_Queen said severely ' Who is this ? ' She said it to the
Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .

' Idiot ! ' said the_Queen , tossing her_head impatiently ; and , turning to
Alice , she went on , ' What 's your_name , child ? '

' My_name is Alice , so please your Majesty , ' said Alice very politely ;
but she added , to herself , ' Why , they 're only_a_pack of cards , after
all . I need n't be afraid of them ! '

' And who are THESE ? ' said the_Queen , pointing to the_three_gardeners who
were lying round the_rosetree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their
faces , and the_pattern on their_backs was the same as the_rest of the
pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or
courtiers , or three of her_own_children .

' How should I know ? ' said Alice , surprised at her_own_courage . ' It 's no
business of MINE . '

The_Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a
moment like a_wild_beast , screamed ' Off with her_head ! Off-- '

' Nonsense ! ' said Alice , very loudly and decidedly , and the_Queen was
silent .

The_King laid his_hand upon her_arm , and timidly said ' Consider , my
dear : she is only_a_child ! '

The_Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the_Knave ' Turn them
over ! '

The_Knave did so , very carefully , with one_foot .

' Get up ! ' said the_Queen , in a_shrill,_loud_voice , and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the_King , the Queen ,
the_royal_children , and everybody else .

' Leave off that ! ' screamed the_Queen . ' You make me giddy . ' And then ,
turning to the_rose - tree , she went on , ' What HAVE you been doing here ? '

' May it please your Majesty , ' said Two , in a_very_humble_tone , going
down on one_knee as he spoke , ' we were trying-- '

' I see ! ' said the_Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the_roses .
' Off with their_heads ! ' and the_procession moved on , three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the_unfortunate_gardeners , who ran
to Alice for protection .

' You sha n't be beheaded ! ' said Alice , and she put them into a large
flower - pot that stood near . The_three_soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the
others .

' Are their_heads off ? ' shouted the_Queen .

' Their_heads are gone , if it please your_Majesty ! ' the_soldiers shouted
in reply .

' That 's right ! ' shouted the_Queen . ' Can you play croquet ? '

The_soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the_question was
evidently meant for her .

' Yes ! ' shouted Alice .

' Come on , then ! ' roared the_Queen , and Alice joined the_procession ,
wondering very much what would happen next .

' It's -- it 's a_very_fine_day ! ' said a_timid_voice at her_side . She was
walking by the_White_Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her_face .

' Very , ' said Alice : ' --where 's the_Duchess ? '

' Hush ! Hush ! ' said the_Rabbit in a_low,_hurried_tone . He looked
anxiously over his_shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon
tiptoe , put his_mouth close to her_ear , and whispered ' She 's under
sentence of execution . '

' What for ? ' said Alice .

' Did you say <unconvertable> What a_pity ! <unconvertable> ? ' the_Rabbit asked .

' No , I did n't , ' said Alice : ' I do n't think it 's at all_a_pity . I said
<unconvertable> What_for ? <unconvertable> '

' She boxed the_Queen 's ears-- ' the_Rabbit began . Alice gave a little
scream of laughter . ' Oh , hush ! ' the_Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone . ' The_Queen will hear you ! You see , she came rather late , and the
Queen said-- '

' Get to your_places ! ' shouted the_Queen in a_voice of thunder , and
people began running about in all_directions , tumbling up against each
other ; however , they got settled down in a_minute or two , and the_game
began . Alice thought she had never seen such_a_curious_croquet - ground in
her_life ; it was all_ridges and furrows ; the_balls were live_hedgehogs ,
the_mallets live flamingoes , and the_soldiers had to double themselves
up and to stand on their_hands and feet , to make the_arches .

The_chief_difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her_flamingo :
she succeeded in getting its_body tucked away , comfortably enough , under
her_arm , with its_legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got
its_neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its_head , it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her_face ,
with such_a_puzzled_expression that she could not help bursting out
laughing : and when she had got its_head down , and was going to begin
again , it was very provoking to find that the_hedgehog had unrolled
itself , and was in the_act of crawling away : besides all this , there was
generally_a_ridge or furrow in the_way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to , and , as the_doubled - up_soldiers were always getting up
and walking off to other_parts of the_ground , Alice soon came to the
conclusion that it was a_very_difficult_game indeed .

The_players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling
all_the_while , and fighting for the_hedgehogs ; and in a very short
time the_Queen was in a_furious_passion , and went stamping about , and
shouting ' Off with his_head ! ' or ' Off with her_head ! ' about once in a
minute .

Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any
dispute with the_Queen , but she knew that it might happen any_minute ,
' and then , ' thought she , ' what would become of me ? They 're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here ; the_great_wonder is , that there 's any one
left alive ! '

She was looking about for some_way of escape , and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen , when she noticed a_curious_appearance
in the_air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it
a minute or two , she made it out to be a_grin , and she said to herself
' It 's the_Cheshire_Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to . '

' How are you getting on ? ' said the_Cat , as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with .

Alice waited till the_eyes appeared , and then nodded . ' It 's no_use
speaking to it , ' she thought , ' till its_ears have come , or at least one
of them . ' In another_minute the_whole_head appeared , and then Alice put
down her_flamingo , and began an_account of the_game , feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her . The_Cat seemed to think that there was
enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared .

' I do n't think they play at all fairly , ' Alice began , in rather a
complaining tone , ' and they all quarrel so dreadfully one ca n't hear
oneself speak -- and they do n't seem to have any_rules in particular ;
at least , if there are , nobody attends to them -- and you 've no_idea how
confusing it is all_the_things being alive ; for instance , there 's the
arch I 've got to go through next walking about at the_other_end of the
ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen 's hedgehog just now , only
it ran away when it saw mine coming ! '

' How do you like the_Queen ? ' said the_Cat in a_low_voice .

' Not at all , ' said Alice : ' she 's so extremely-- ' Just then she noticed
that the_Queen was close behind her , listening : so she went on ,
' --likely to win , that it 's hardly worth while finishing the_game . '

The_Queen smiled and passed on .

' Who ARE you talking to ? ' said the_King , going up to Alice , and looking
at the_Cat's_head with great_curiosity .

' It 's a_friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat , ' said Alice : ' allow me to
introduce it . '

' I do n't like the_look of it at all , ' said the_King : ' however , it may
kiss my_hand if it likes . '

' I 'd rather not , ' the_Cat remarked .

' Do n't be impertinent , ' said the_King , ' and do n't look at me like that ! '
He got behind Alice as he spoke .

' A_cat may look at a_king , ' said Alice . ' I 've read that in some_book ,
but I do n't remember where . '

' Well , it must be removed , ' said the_King very decidedly , and he called
the_Queen , who was passing at the_moment , ' My dear ! I wish you would
have this_cat removed ! '

The_Queen had only_one_way of settling all_difficulties , great or small .
' Off with his_head ! ' she said , without even looking round .

' I 'll fetch the_executioner myself , ' said the_King eagerly , and he
hurried off .

Alice thought she might as well go back , and see how the_game was going
on , as she heard the_Queen's_voice in the_distance , screaming with
passion . She had already heard her sentence three of the_players to be
executed for having missed their_turns , and she did not like the_look
of things at all , as the_game was in such_confusion that she never knew
whether it was her_turn or not . So she went in search of her_hedgehog .

The_hedgehog was engaged in a_fight with another_hedgehog , which seemed
to Alice an_excellent_opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other : the_only_difficulty was , that her_flamingo was gone across to the
other_side of the_garden , where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a_tree .

By the_time she had caught the_flamingo and brought it back , the_fight
was over , and both the_hedgehogs were out of sight : ' but it does n't
matter much , ' thought Alice , ' as all_the_arches are gone from this_side
of the_ground . ' So she tucked it away under her_arm , that it might not
escape again , and went back for a_little_more_conversation with her
friend .

When she got back to the_Cheshire_Cat , she was surprised to find quite a
large_crowd collected round it : there was a_dispute going on between
the_executioner , the King , and the Queen , who were all talking at once ,
while all the_rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .

The_moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle
the_question , and they repeated their_arguments to her , though , as they
all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said .

The_executioner's_argument was , that you could n't cut off a_head unless
there was a_body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a
thing before , and he was n't going to begin at HIS_time of life .

The_King's_argument was , that anything that had a_head could be
beheaded , and that you were n't to talk nonsense .

The_Queen's_argument was , that if something was n't done about it in less
than no_time she 'd have everybody executed , all round . ( It was this last
remark that had made the_whole_party look so grave and anxious . )

Alice could think of nothing else to say but ' It belongs to the_Duchess :
you 'd better ask HER about it . '

' She 's in prison , ' the_Queen said to the_executioner : ' fetch her here . '
And the_executioner went off like an_arrow .

<unconvertable> The Cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone , and ,
by the_time he had come back with the_Duchess , it had entirely
disappeared ; so the_King and the_executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it , while the_rest of the_party went back to the_game .




CHAPTER_IX . The_Mock_Turtle's_Story

' You ca n't think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing ! '
said the_Duchess , as she tucked her_arm affectionately into Alice 's , and
they walked off together .

Alice was very glad to find her in such_a_pleasant_temper , and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only_the_pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the_kitchen .

' When I'M a Duchess , ' she said to herself , ( not in a_very_hopeful_tone
though ) , ' I wo n't have any_pepper in my_kitchen_AT_ALL . Soup does very
well without -- Maybe it 's always pepper that makes people hot - tempered , '
she went on , very much pleased at having found out a_new_kind of
rule , ' and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes
them bitter -- and -- and barley - sugar and such things that make children
sweet - tempered . I only wish people knew that : then they would n't be so
stingy about it , you know-- '

She had quite forgotten the_Duchess by this_time , and was a little
startled when she heard her_voice close to her_ear . ' You 're thinking
about something , my_dear , and that makes you forget to talk . I ca n't
tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in
a_bit . '

' Perhaps it hasn't one , ' Alice ventured to remark .

' Tut , tut , child ! ' said the_Duchess . ' Everything 's got a moral , if only
you can find it . ' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's_side as
she spoke .

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the
Duchess was VERY ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the
right_height to rest her_chin upon Alice's_shoulder , and it was an
uncomfortably_sharp_chin . However , she did not like to be rude , so she
bore it as well as she could .

' The_game 's going on rather better now , ' she said , by way of keeping up
the_conversation a little .

' ' Tis_so , ' said the_Duchess : ' and the moral of that_is--Oh , ' tis_love ,
' tis love , that makes the_world go round ! <unconvertable> '

' Somebody said , ' Alice whispered , ' that it 's done by everybody minding
their_own_business ! '

' Ah , well ! It means much_the_same_thing , ' said the_Duchess , digging her
sharp_little_chin into Alice's_shoulder as she added , ' and the moral
of THAT_is--Take_care of the_sense , and the_sounds will take care of
themselves . <unconvertable> '

' How fond she is of finding morals in things!'_Alice thought to herself .

' I dare say you 're wondering why I do n't put my arm round your_waist , '
the_Duchess said after a_pause : ' the_reason is , that I 'm doubtful about
the_temper of your_flamingo . Shall I try the_experiment ? '

' HE might bite , ' Alice cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to
have the_experiment tried .

' Very true , ' said the_Duchess : ' flamingoes and mustard both bite . And
the moral of that_is--Birds of a_feather_flock together . <unconvertable> '

' Only_mustard is n't a_bird , ' Alice remarked .

' Right , as usual , ' said the_Duchess : ' what_a_clear_way you have of
putting things ! '

' It 's a_mineral , I THINK , ' said Alice .

' Of_course_it is , ' said the_Duchess , who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said ; ' there 's a_large_mustard - mine near here . And
the moral of that is--The more there is of mine , the less there is of
yours . <unconvertable> '

' Oh , I know ! ' exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this_last_remark ,
' it 's a_vegetable . It does n't look like one , but it is . '

' I quite agree with you , ' said the_Duchess ; ' and the moral of that
is--Be what you would seem to be--or if you 'd like it put more
simply--Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise . <unconvertable> '

' I think I should understand that better,'_Alice said very politely , ' if
I had it written down : but I ca n't quite follow it as you say it . '

' That 's nothing to what I could say if I chose , ' the_Duchess replied , in
a_pleased_tone .

' Pray do n't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that , ' said
Alice .

' Oh , do n't talk about trouble ! ' said the_Duchess . ' I make you a present
of everything I 've said as yet . '

' A_cheap_sort of present ! ' thought Alice . ' I 'm glad they do n't give
birthday presents like that ! ' But she did not venture to say it out
loud .

' Thinking again ? ' the_Duchess asked , with another_dig of her sharp
little_chin .

' I 've a_right to think , ' said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to
feel a little worried .

' Just about as much_right , ' said the_Duchess , ' as pigs have to fly ; and
the_m-- '

But here , to Alice's_great_surprise , the_Duchess's_voice died away , even
in the_middle of her_favourite_word ' moral , ' and the_arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up , and there stood the_Queen
in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a_thunderstorm .

' A fine day , your_Majesty ! ' the_Duchess began in a_low,_weak_voice .

' Now , I give you fair_warning , ' shouted the_Queen , stamping on the
ground as she spoke ; ' either_you or your_head must be off , and that in
about half no time ! Take your_choice ! '

The_Duchess took her_choice , and was gone in a_moment .

' Let 's go on with the_game , ' the_Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was
too much frightened to say a_word , but slowly followed her back to the
croquet - ground .

The_other_guests had taken advantage of the_Queen's_absence , and were
resting in the_shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried
back to the_game , the_Queen merely remarking that a_moment's_delay would
cost them their_lives .

All the time they were playing the_Queen never left off quarrelling with
the_other_players , and shouting ' Off with his_head ! ' or ' Off with her
head ! ' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the_soldiers ,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by
the_end of half_an_hour or so there were no_arches left , and all the
players , except the_King , the_Queen , and Alice , were in custody and
under sentence of execution .

Then the_Queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to Alice , ' Have
you seen the_Mock_Turtle_yet ? '

' No , ' said Alice . ' I do n't even know what a Mock Turtle is . '

' It 's the_thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from , ' said the_Queen .

' I never saw one , or heard of one , ' said Alice .

' Come on , then , ' said the_Queen , ' and he shall tell you his_history , '

As they walked off together , Alice heard the_King say in a_low_voice ,
to the_company generally , ' You are all_pardoned . ' ' Come , THAT 'S a good
thing ! ' she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the_Queen had ordered .

They very soon came upon a_Gryphon , lying fast asleep in the_sun .
( IF you do n't know what a_Gryphon is , look at the_picture . ) ' Up , lazy
thing ! ' said the_Queen , ' and take this_young_lady to see the_Mock
Turtle , and to hear his_history . I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered ' ; and she walked off , leaving Alice alone with
the_Gryphon . Alice did not quite like the_look of the_creature , but on
the_whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that_savage_Queen : so she waited .

The_Gryphon sat up and rubbed its_eyes : then it watched the_Queen till
she was out of sight : then it chuckled . ' What_fun ! ' said the_Gryphon ,
half to itself , half to Alice .

' What IS the_fun ? ' said Alice .

' Why , SHE , ' said the_Gryphon . ' It 's all her fancy , that : they never
executes nobody , you know . Come on ! '

' Everybody says <unconvertable> come on ! <unconvertable> here , ' thought Alice , as she went slowly
after it : ' I never was so ordered about in all_my_life , never ! '

They had not gone far before they saw the_Mock_Turtle in the_distance ,
sitting sad and lonely on a_little_ledge of rock , and , as they came
nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his_heart would break . She
pitied him deeply . ' What is his_sorrow ? ' she asked the_Gryphon , and the
Gryphon answered , very nearly in the_same_words as before , ' It 's all his
fancy , that : he hasn't got no_sorrow , you know . Come on ! '

So they went up to the_Mock_Turtle , who looked at them with large_eyes
full of tears , but said nothing .

' This_here_young_lady , ' said the_Gryphon , ' she wants for to know your
history , she do . '

' I 'll tell it her , ' said the_Mock_Turtle in a_deep,_hollow_tone : ' sit
down , both of you , and do n't speak a_word till I 've finished . '

So they sat down , and nobody spoke for some_minutes . Alice thought to
herself , ' I do n't see how he can EVEN finish , if he does n't begin . ' But
she waited patiently .

' Once , ' said the_Mock_Turtle at last , with a_deep_sigh , ' I was a real
Turtle . '

These_words were followed by a_very_long_silence , broken only by an
occasional_exclamation of ' Hjckrrh ! ' from the_Gryphon , and the constant
heavy_sobbing of the_Mock_Turtle . Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying , ' Thank you , sir , for your_interesting_story , ' but she could
not help thinking there MUST be more to come , so she sat still and said
nothing .

' When we were little , ' the_Mock_Turtle went on at last , more calmly ,
though still sobbing a little now and then , ' we went to school in the
sea . The_master was an_old_Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise-- '

' Why did you call him Tortoise , if he was n't one ? ' Alice asked .

' We called him Tortoise because he taught us , ' said the_Mock_Turtle
angrily : ' really you are very dull ! '

' You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such_a_simple_question , '
added the_Gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice , who felt ready to sink into the_earth . At last the_Gryphon said
to the_Mock_Turtle , ' Drive on , old fellow ! Do n't be all_day about it ! '
and he went on in these_words :

' Yes , we went to school in the_sea , though you may n't believe it-- '

' I never said I did n't ! ' interrupted Alice .

' You did , ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' Hold your_tongue ! ' added the_Gryphon , before Alice could speak again .
The_Mock_Turtle went on .

' We had the best of educations -- in fact , we went to school every_day-- '

' I'VE been to a_day - school , too , ' said Alice ; ' you need n't be so proud
as all that . '

' With extras ? ' asked the_Mock_Turtle a little anxiously .

' Yes , ' said Alice , ' we learned French and music . '

' And washing ? ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' Certainly not ! ' said Alice indignantly .

' Ah ! then yours wasn't_a_really_good_school , ' said the_Mock_Turtle in
a_tone of great_relief . ' Now at OURS they had at the_end of the_bill ,
<unconvertable> French , music , AND WASHING -- extra . <unconvertable> '

' You could n't have wanted it much , ' said Alice ; ' living at the_bottom of
the_sea . '

' I could n't afford to learn it . ' said the_Mock_Turtle with a_sigh . ' I
only took the_regular_course . '

' What was that ? ' inquired Alice .

' Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with , ' the_Mock_Turtle
replied ; ' and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition ,
Distraction , Uglification , and Derision . '

' I never heard of <unconvertable> Uglification,'_Alice ventured to say . ' What is it ? '

The_Gryphon lifted up both_its_paws in surprise . ' What ! Never heard of
uglifying ! ' it exclaimed . ' You know what to beautify is , I suppose ? '

' Yes , ' said Alice doubtfully : ' it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier . '

' Well , then , ' the_Gryphon went on , ' if you do n't know what to uglify is ,
you ARE a_simpleton . '

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any_more_questions about it , so_she
turned to the_Mock_Turtle , and said ' What else had you to learn ? '

' Well , there was Mystery , ' the_Mock_Turtle replied , counting off
the_subjects on his_flappers , ' --Mystery , ancient and modern , with
Seaography : then Drawling -- the_Drawling - master was an_old_conger - eel ,
that used to come once a week : HE taught us Drawling , Stretching , and
Fainting in Coils . '

' What was THAT_like ? ' said Alice .

' Well , I ca n't show it you myself , ' the_Mock_Turtle said : ' I 'm too
stiff . And the_Gryphon never learnt it . '

' Hadn't_time , ' said the_Gryphon : ' I went to the_Classics_master , though .
He was an_old_crab , HE was . '

' I never went to him , ' the_Mock_Turtle said with a_sigh : ' he taught
Laughing and Grief , they used to say . '

' So he did , so he did , ' said the_Gryphon , sighing in his_turn ; and both
creatures hid their_faces in their_paws .

' And how many hours a day did you do lessons ? ' said Alice , in a_hurry to
change the_subject .

' Ten hours the_first_day , ' said the_Mock_Turtle : ' nine the next , and so
on . '

' What a_curious_plan ! ' exclaimed Alice .

' That 's the_reason they 're called lessons , ' the_Gryphon remarked :
' because they lessen from day to day . '

This was quite_a_new_idea to Alice , and she thought it over a little
before she made her_next_remark . ' Then the_eleventh_day must have been a
holiday ? '

' Of course it was , ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' And how did you manage on the_twelfth?'_Alice went on eagerly .

' That 's enough about lessons , ' the_Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone : ' tell her something about the_games now . '




CHAPTER_X. The Lobster Quadrille

The_Mock_Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the_back of one_flapper across
his_eyes . He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a_minute or
two_sobs choked his_voice . ' Same as if he had a_bone in his_throat , '
said the_Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the_back . At last the_Mock_Turtle recovered his_voice , and , with tears
running down his_cheeks , he went on again:--

' You may not have lived much under the_sea-- ' [ ' I haven't , ' said
Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a_lobster-- '
( Alice began to say ' I once tasted-- ' but checked herself hastily , and
said ' No , never ' ) ' --so you can have no_idea what a_delightful_thing a
Lobster_Quadrille_is ! '

' No , indeed , ' said Alice . ' What_sort of a_dance is it ? '

' Why , ' said the_Gryphon , ' you first form into a_line along the
sea - shore-- '

' Two lines ! ' cried the_Mock_Turtle . ' Seals , turtles , salmon , and so on ;
then , when you 've cleared all_the_jelly - fish out of the_way-- '

' THAT generally takes some_time , ' interrupted the_Gryphon .

' --you advance_twice-- '

' Each with a_lobster as a_partner ! ' cried the_Gryphon .

' Of course , ' the_Mock_Turtle said : ' advance twice , set to partners-- '

' --change_lobsters , and retire in same_order , ' continued the_Gryphon .

' Then , you know , ' the_Mock_Turtle went on , ' you throw the-- '

' The_lobsters ! ' shouted the_Gryphon , with a bound into the_air .

' --as far out to sea as you can-- '

' Swim after them ! ' screamed the_Gryphon .

' Turn a_somersault in the_sea ! ' cried the_Mock_Turtle , capering wildly
about .

' Change_lobsters again ! ' yelled the_Gryphon at the_top of its_voice .

' Back to land again , and that 's all_the_first_figure , ' said the_Mock
Turtle , suddenly dropping his_voice ; and the_two_creatures , who had been
jumping about like mad_things all this time , sat down again very sadly
and quietly , and looked at Alice .

' It must be a_very_pretty_dance , ' said Alice timidly .

' Would you like to see a little of it ? ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' Very much indeed , ' said Alice .

' Come , let 's try the_first_figure ! ' said the_Mock_Turtle to the_Gryphon .
' We can do without lobsters , you know . Which shall sing ? '

' Oh , YOU_sing , ' said the_Gryphon . ' I 've forgotten the_words . '

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice , every now and
then treading on her_toes when they passed too close , and waving their
forepaws to mark the_time , while the_Mock_Turtle sang this , very slowly
and sadly:--

<unconvertable> ' <unconvertable> Will you walk a little faster ? <unconvertable> said a_whiting to a_snail .
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> There 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my_tail .

<unconvertable> See how eagerly the_lobsters and the_turtles all advance !
_ They are waiting on the_shingle -- will you come and join the_dance ?

<unconvertable> Will you , won't_you , will you , won't_you , will you join the_dance ?
<unconvertable> Will you , won't_you , will you , won't_you , won't_you join the_dance ?

<unconvertable> <unconvertable> You can really have no_notion how delightful it will be
<unconvertable> When they take us up and throw us , with the_lobsters , out to sea ! <unconvertable>
<unconvertable> But the_snail replied <unconvertable> Too far , too far ! <unconvertable> and gave a_look askance--
<unconvertable> Said he thanked the_whiting kindly , but he would not join the_dance .

<unconvertable> Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the_dance .
<unconvertable> Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the_dance .

<unconvertable> ' <unconvertable> What matters it how far we go ? <unconvertable> his_scaly_friend replied .
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> There is another_shore , you know , upon the_other_side .
<unconvertable> The further off from England the_nearer is to France--
<unconvertable> Then turn not_pale,_beloved_snail , but come and join the_dance .

<unconvertable> Will you , won't_you , will you , won't_you , will you join the_dance ?
<unconvertable> Will you , won't_you , will you , won't_you , won't_you join the_dance ? <unconvertable> '

' Thank you , it 's a_very_interesting_dance to watch , ' said Alice , feeling
very glad that it was over at last : ' and I do so like that_curious_song
about the_whiting ! '

' Oh , as to the_whiting , ' said the_Mock_Turtle , ' they -- you've seen them ,
of course ? '

' Yes , ' said Alice , ' I 've often seen them at dinn-- ' she checked herself
hastily .

' I do n't know where Dinn may be , ' said the_Mock_Turtle , ' but if you 've
seen them so often , of course you know what they 're like . '

' I believe so , ' Alice replied thoughtfully . ' They have their_tails in
their_mouths -- and they 're all over crumbs . '

' You 're wrong about the_crumbs , ' said the_Mock_Turtle : ' crumbs would all
wash off in the_sea . But they HAVE their_tails in their_mouths ; and the
reason is-- ' here the_Mock_Turtle yawned and shut his_eyes.--'Tell her
about the_reason and all that , ' he said to the_Gryphon .

' The_reason_is , ' said the_Gryphon , ' that they WOULD go with the_lobsters
to the_dance . So they got thrown out to sea . So they had to fall a long
way . So they got their_tails fast in their_mouths . So they could n't get
them out again . That 's all . '

' Thank you , ' said Alice , ' it 's very interesting . I never knew so much
about a_whiting_before . '

' I can tell you more than that , if you like , ' said the_Gryphon . ' Do you
know why it 's called a_whiting ? '

' I never thought about it , ' said Alice . ' Why ? '

' IT DOES THE_BOOTS AND SHOES . ' the_Gryphon replied very solemnly .

Alice was thoroughly puzzled . ' Does the_boots and shoes ! ' she repeated
in a_wondering_tone .

' Why , what are YOUR_shoes done with ? ' said the_Gryphon . ' I mean , what
makes them so shiny ? '

Alice looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her
answer . ' They 're done with blacking , I believe . '

' Boots and shoes under the_sea , ' the_Gryphon went on in a_deep_voice ,
' are done with a_whiting . Now you know . '

' And what are they made of ? ' Alice asked in a_tone of great_curiosity .

' Soles and eels , of course , ' the_Gryphon replied rather impatiently :
' any_shrimp could have told you that . '

' If I 'd been the_whiting , ' said Alice , whose thoughts were still running
on the_song , ' I 'd have said to the_porpoise , <unconvertable> Keep back , please : we
do n't want YOU with us ! <unconvertable> '

' They were obliged to have him with them , ' the_Mock_Turtle said : ' no
wise_fish would go anywhere without a_porpoise . '

' Wouldn't_it really ? ' said Alice in a_tone of great_surprise .

' Of course not , ' said the_Mock_Turtle : ' why , if a_fish came to ME , and
told me he was going a_journey , I should say <unconvertable> With what_porpoise ? <unconvertable> '

' Do n't you mean <unconvertable> purpose <unconvertable> ? ' said Alice .

' I mean what I say , ' the_Mock_Turtle replied in an_offended_tone . And
the_Gryphon added ' Come , let 's hear some of YOUR_adventures . '

' I could tell you my_adventures -- beginning from this_morning , ' said
Alice a little timidly : ' but it 's no_use going back to yesterday ,
because I was a_different_person then . '

' Explain all that , ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' No , no ! The_adventures first , ' said the_Gryphon in an_impatient_tone :
' explanations take such_a_dreadful_time . '

So Alice began telling them her_adventures from the_time when she first
saw the_White_Rabbit . She was a little nervous about it just at first ,
the_two_creatures got so close to her , one on each_side , and opened
their_eyes and mouths so VERY wide , but she gained courage as she went
on . Her_listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the_part about
her_repeating ' YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , ' to the_Caterpillar , and the
words all coming different , and then the_Mock_Turtle drew a_long_breath ,
and said ' That 's very curious . '

' It 's all about as curious as it can be , ' said the_Gryphon .

' It all came different ! ' the_Mock_Turtle repeated thoughtfully . ' I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now . Tell her to
begin.'_He looked at the_Gryphon as if he thought it had some_kind of
authority over Alice .

' Stand up and repeat <unconvertable> ' TIS THE VOICE OF THE_SLUGGARD , <unconvertable> ' said the
Gryphon .

' How the_creatures_order one about , and make one repeat lessons ! '
thought Alice ; ' I might as well be at school at once . ' However,_she
got up , and began to repeat it , but her_head was so full of the_Lobster
Quadrille , that she hardly knew what she was saying , and the_words came
very queer indeed:--

<unconvertable> ' ' Tis the_voice of the_Lobster ; I heard him declare ,
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> You have baked me too brown , I must sugar my_hair . <unconvertable>
<unconvertable> As a_duck with its_eyelids , so_he with his_nose
<unconvertable> Trims his_belt and his_buttons , and turns out his_toes . '

<unconvertable> [ later_editions continued as follows
<unconvertable> When the_sands are all dry , he is gay as a_lark ,
<unconvertable> And will talk in contemptuous_tones of the_Shark ,
<unconvertable> But , when the_tide rises and sharks are around ,
_ _ His_voice has a_timid_and_tremulous_sound . ]

' That 's different from what I used to say when I was a_child , ' said the
Gryphon .

' Well , I never heard it before , ' said the_Mock_Turtle ; ' but it sounds
uncommon nonsense . '

Alice said nothing ; she had sat down with her_face in her_hands ,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a_natural_way again .

' I should like to have it explained , ' said the_Mock_Turtle .

' She ca n't explain it , ' said the_Gryphon hastily . ' Go on with the next
verse . '

' But about his_toes ? ' the Mock_Turtle persisted . ' How COULD he turn them
out with his_nose , you know ? '

' It 's the_first_position in dancing.'_Alice said ; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the_whole_thing , and longed to change the_subject .

' Go on with the_next_verse , ' the Gryphon repeated impatiently : ' it
begins <unconvertable> I passed by his_garden . <unconvertable> '

Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come
wrong , and she went on in a_trembling voice:--

<unconvertable> ' I passed by his_garden , and marked , with one_eye ,
<unconvertable> How the Owl and the_Panther were sharing a_pie-- '

<unconvertable> [ later_editions continued as follows
_ _ The_Panther took pie - crust , and gravy , and meat ,
<unconvertable> While the_Owl had the_dish as its_share of the_treat .
<unconvertable> When the_pie was all finished , the_Owl , as a_boon ,
<unconvertable> Was kindly permitted to pocket the_spoon :
<unconvertable> While the_Panther received knife and fork with a_growl ,
<unconvertable> And concluded the_banquet-- ]

' What IS the_use of repeating all that stuff , ' the_Mock_Turtle
interrupted , ' if you do n't explain it as you go on ? It 's by far the most
confusing_thing I ever heard ! '

' Yes , I think you 'd better leave off , ' said the_Gryphon : and Alice was
only too glad to do so .

' Shall we try another_figure of the_Lobster_Quadrille ? ' the_Gryphon went
on . ' Or would you like the_Mock_Turtle to sing you a_song ? '

' Oh , a_song , please , if the_Mock_Turtle would be so kind , ' Alice
replied , so eagerly that the_Gryphon said , in a_rather_offended_tone ,
' Hm ! No_accounting for tastes ! Sing her <unconvertable> Turtle_Soup , <unconvertable> will you , old
fellow ? '

The_Mock_Turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a_voice sometimes choked
with sobs , to sing this:--

_ _ _ ' Beautiful_Soup , so rich and green ,
<unconvertable> Waiting in a_hot_tureen !
_ _ _ Who for such_dainties would not stoop ?
_ _ _ Soup of the_evening , beautiful_Soup !
_ _ _ Soup of the_evening , beautiful_Soup !
_ _ _ _ _ Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
_ _ _ _ _ Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
_ _ _ Soo -- oop of the_e -- e -- evening ,
<unconvertable> Beautiful , beautiful Soup !

_ _ _ ' Beautiful_Soup ! Who cares for fish ,
_ _ _ Game , or any_other_dish ?
_ _ _ Who would not give all else for two
_ _ _ Pennyworth only of beautiful_Soup ?
_ _ _ Pennyworth only of beautiful_Soup ?
_ _ _ _ _ Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
_ _ _ _ _ Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
_ _ _ Soo -- oop of the_e -- e -- evening ,
<unconvertable> Beautiful , beauti -- FUL SOUP ! '

' Chorus_again ! ' cried the_Gryphon , and the_Mock_Turtle had just begun
to repeat it , when a_cry of ' The_trial 's beginning ! ' was heard in the
distance .

' Come on ! ' cried the_Gryphon , and , taking Alice by the_hand , it hurried
off , without waiting for the_end of the_song .

' What_trial is it ? ' Alice panted as she ran ; but the_Gryphon only
answered ' Come on ! ' and ran the faster , while more and more faintly
came , carried on the_breeze that followed them , the melancholy words:--

_ _ _ ' Soo -- oop of the_e -- e -- evening ,
<unconvertable> Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! '




CHAPTER_XI . Who Stole the_Tarts ?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their_throne when they
arrived , with a_great_crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little
birds and beasts , as well as the_whole_pack of cards : the Knave was
standing before them , in chains , with a_soldier on each_side to guard
him ; and near the_King was the_White_Rabbit , with a_trumpet in one_hand ,
and a_scroll of parchment in the other . In the_very_middle of the_court
was a_table , with a_large_dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good ,
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they 'd get the
trial done , ' she thought , ' and hand round the_refreshments ! ' But there
seemed to be no_chance of this , so she began looking at everything about
her , to pass away the_time .

Alice had never been in a_court of justice before , but she had read
about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the_name of nearly_everything there . ' That 's the_judge , ' she said to
herself , ' because of his_great_wig . '

The_judge , by the_way , was the_King ; and as he wore his_crown over the
wig , ( look at the_frontispiece if you want to see how he did it , ) he did
not look at all comfortable , and it was certainly not becoming .

' And that 's the_jury - box , ' thought Alice , ' and those_twelve_creatures , '
( she was obliged to say ' creatures , ' you see , because some of them were
animals , and some were birds , ) ' I suppose they are the_jurors . ' She said
this_last_word two or three times over to herself , being rather proud of
it : for she thought , and rightly too , that very few little girls of her
age knew the_meaning of it at all . However , ' jury - men ' would have done
just as well .

The_twelve_jurors were all writing very busily on slates . ' What are they
doing?'_Alice whispered to the_Gryphon . ' They ca n't have anything to put
down yet , before the_trial 's begun . '

' They 're putting down their names , ' the_Gryphon whispered in reply , ' for
fear they should forget them before the_end of the_trial . '

' Stupid things ! ' Alice began in a_loud,_indignant_voice , but she stopped
hastily , for the_White_Rabbit cried out , ' Silence in the_court ! ' and the
King put on his_spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who
was talking .

Alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their_shoulders ,
that all the_jurors were writing down ' stupid_things ! ' on their_slates ,
and she could even make out that one of them did n't know how to spell
' stupid , ' and that he had to ask his_neighbour to tell him . ' A nice
muddle their_slates'll be in before the_trial 's over ! ' thought Alice .

One of the_jurors had a_pencil that squeaked . This of course , Alice
could not stand , and she went round the_court and got behind him , and
very soon found an_opportunity of taking it away . She did it so quickly
that the_poor_little_juror ( it was Bill , the Lizard ) could not make out
at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was
obliged to write with one_finger for the_rest of the_day ; and this was
of very_little_use , as it left no_mark on the_slate .

' Herald , read the_accusation ! ' said the_King .

On this the_White_Rabbit blew three_blasts on the_trumpet , and then
unrolled the_parchment_scroll , and read as follows:--

<unconvertable> ' The Queen of Hearts , she made some_tarts ,
<unconvertable> All on a_summer_day :
<unconvertable> The Knave of Hearts , he stole those_tarts ,
<unconvertable> And took them quite away ! '

' Consider your_verdict , ' the King said to the_jury .

' Not yet , not yet ! ' the_Rabbit hastily interrupted . ' There 's a great
deal to come before that ! '

' Call the_first_witness , ' said the_King ; and the_White_Rabbit blew three
blasts on the_trumpet , and called out , ' First witness ! '

The_first_witness was the_Hatter . He came in with a_teacup in one
hand and a_piece of bread - and - butter in the other . ' I beg pardon , your
Majesty , ' he began , ' for bringing these in : but I had n't quite finished
my_tea when I was sent for . '

' You ought to have finished , ' said the_King . ' When did you begin ? '

The_Hatter looked at the_March_Hare , who had followed him into the
court , arm - in - arm with the_Dormouse . ' Fourteenth of March , I think it
was , ' he said .

' Fifteenth , ' said the_March_Hare .

' Sixteenth , ' added the_Dormouse .

' Write that down , ' the_King said to the_jury , and the_jury eagerly
wrote down all_three_dates on their_slates , and then added them up , and
reduced the_answer to shillings and pence .

' Take off your hat , ' the King said to the_Hatter .

' It isn't_mine , ' said the_Hatter .

' Stolen ! ' the_King exclaimed , turning to the_jury , who instantly made a
memorandum of the_fact .

' I keep them to sell , ' the_Hatter added as an_explanation ; ' I 've none of
my own . I 'm a_hatter . '

Here the_Queen put on her_spectacles , and began staring at the_Hatter ,
who turned pale and fidgeted .

' Give your_evidence , ' said the_King ; ' and do n't be nervous , or I 'll have
you executed on the_spot . '

This did not seem to encourage the_witness at all : he kept shifting
from one_foot to the other , looking uneasily at the_Queen , and in
his confusion he bit a_large_piece out of his_teacup instead of the
bread - and - butter .

Just at this_moment Alice felt a_very_curious_sensation , which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to
grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the_court ; but on second_thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her .

' I wish you would n't squeeze so . ' said the_Dormouse , who was sitting
next to her . ' I can hardly breathe . '

' I ca n't help it , ' said Alice very meekly : ' I 'm growing . '

' You 've no right to grow here , ' said the_Dormouse .

' Don't_talk_nonsense , ' said Alice more boldly : ' you know you 're growing
too . '

' Yes , but I grow at a_reasonable_pace , ' said the_Dormouse : ' not in that
ridiculous_fashion . ' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other_side of the_court .

All this time the_Queen had never left off staring at the_Hatter , and ,
just as the_Dormouse crossed the_court , she said to one of the_officers
of the_court , ' Bring me the_list of the_singers in the_last_concert ! ' on
which the_wretched_Hatter trembled so , that he shook both_his_shoes off .

' Give your evidence , ' the_King repeated angrily , ' or I 'll have you
executed , whether you 're nervous or not . '

' I 'm a_poor_man , your_Majesty , ' the_Hatter began , in a_trembling_voice ,
' --and I had n't begun my_tea -- not above a_week or so -- and what with the
bread - and - butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the_tea-- '

' The_twinkling of the_what ? ' said the_King .

' It began with the_tea , ' the Hatter replied .

' Of course twinkling begins with a_T ! ' said the_King sharply . ' Do you
take me for a_dunce ? Go on ! '

' I 'm a_poor_man , ' the_Hatter went on , ' and most things twinkled after
that -- only the March Hare said-- '

' I did n't ! ' the_March_Hare interrupted in a_great_hurry .

' You did ! ' said the_Hatter .

' I deny it ! ' said the_March_Hare .

' He denies it , ' said the_King : ' leave out that part . '

' Well , at any_rate , the_Dormouse_said-- ' the_Hatter went on , looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the_Dormouse denied
nothing , being fast asleep .

' After that , ' continued the_Hatter , ' I cut some_more_bread - and - butter-- '

' But what did the_Dormouse_say ? ' one of the_jury asked .

' That_I ca n't remember , ' said the_Hatter .

' You MUST remember , ' remarked the_King , ' or I 'll have you executed . '

The_miserable_Hatter dropped his teacup and bread - and - butter , and went
down on one_knee . ' I 'm a_poor_man , your Majesty , ' he began .

' You 're a_very_poor_speaker , ' said the_King .

Here one of the_guinea - pigs cheered , and was immediately suppressed by
the_officers of the_court . ( As that is rather_a_hard_word , I will just
explain to you how it was done . They had a_large_canvas_bag , which tied
up at the_mouth with strings : into this they slipped the_guinea - pig ,
head first , and then sat upon it . )

' I 'm glad I 've seen that_done,'_thought Alice . ' I 've so often read
in the_newspapers , at the_end of trials , <unconvertable> There was some_attempts
at applause , which was immediately suppressed by the_officers of the
court , <unconvertable> and I never understood what it meant till now . '

' If that 's all you know about it , you may stand down , ' continued the
King .

' I ca n't go no_lower , ' said the_Hatter : ' I 'm on the_floor , as it is . '

' Then you may SIT down , ' the_King replied .

Here the_other_guinea - pig cheered , and was suppressed .

' Come , that finished the guinea - pigs ! ' thought Alice . ' Now we shall get
on better . '

' I 'd rather finish my_tea , ' said the_Hatter , with an_anxious_look at the
Queen , who was reading the_list of singers .

' You may go , ' said the_King , and the_Hatter hurriedly left the_court ,
without even waiting to put his_shoes on .

' --and just take his_head off outside , ' the_Queen added to one of the
officers : but the_Hatter was out of sight before the_officer could get
to the_door .

' Call the_next_witness ! ' said the_King .

The_next_witness was the_Duchess's_cook . She carried the_pepper - box in
her_hand , and Alice guessed who it was , even before she got into the
court , by the_way the_people near the_door began sneezing all at once .

' Give your_evidence , ' said the_King .

' Sha n't , ' said the_cook .

The_King looked anxiously at the_White_Rabbit , who said in a_low_voice ,
' Your_Majesty must cross - examine THIS witness . '

' Well , if I must , I must , ' the_King said , with a_melancholy_air , and ,
after folding his_arms and frowning at the_cook till his_eyes were
nearly out of sight , he said in a_deep_voice , ' What are tarts made of ? '

' Pepper , mostly , ' said the_cook .

' Treacle , ' said a_sleepy_voice behind her .

' Collar that Dormouse , ' the_Queen shrieked out . ' Behead that Dormouse !
Turn that Dormouse out of court ! Suppress him ! Pinch him ! Off with his
whiskers ! '

For some_minutes the_whole_court was in confusion , getting the_Dormouse
turned out , and , by the_time they had settled down again , the_cook had
disappeared .

' Never mind ! ' said the_King , with an_air of great_relief . ' Call the next
witness . ' And he added in an_undertone to the_Queen , ' Really , my_dear ,
YOU must cross - examine the_next_witness . It quite makes my_forehead
ache ! '

Alice watched the_White_Rabbit as he fumbled over the_list , feeling very
curious to see what the_next_witness would be like , ' --for they haven't
got much_evidence YET , ' she said to herself . Imagine her_surprise , when
the_White_Rabbit read out , at the_top of his_shrill_little_voice , the
name ' Alice ! '




CHAPTER_XII . Alice's_Evidence


' Here ! ' cried Alice , quite forgetting in the_flurry of the_moment how
large she had grown in the_last_few_minutes , and she jumped up in such
a_hurry that she tipped over the_jury - box with the_edge of her_skirt ,
upsetting all_the_jurymen on to the_heads of the_crowd below , and there
they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a_globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before .

' Oh , I BEG your_pardon ! ' she exclaimed in a_tone of great_dismay , and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the_accident of
the_goldfish kept running in her_head , and she had a_vague_sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the_jury - box , or
they would die .

' The_trial can not proceed , ' said the_King in a_very_grave_voice , ' until
all_the_jurymen are back in their_proper_places -- ALL , ' he repeated with
great_emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do .

Alice looked at the_jury - box , and saw that , in her_haste , she had put
the_Lizard in head_downwards , and the_poor_little_thing was waving its
tail about in a_melancholy_way , being quite unable to move . She soon got
it out again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much , ' she said
to herself ; ' I should think it would be QUITE as much_use in the_trial
one way up as the_other . '

As soon as the_jury had a little recovered from the_shock of being
upset , and their_slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them , they set to work very diligently to write out a_history of the
accident , all except the_Lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its_mouth open , gazing up into the_roof of the
court .

' What do you know about this_business ? ' the_King said to Alice .

' Nothing , ' said Alice .

' Nothing WHATEVER ? ' persisted the_King .

' Nothing whatever , ' said Alice .

' That 's very important , ' the_King said , turning to the_jury . They were
just beginning to write this down on their_slates , when the_White_Rabbit
interrupted : ' UNimportant , your_Majesty means , of course , ' he said in a
very_respectful_tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .

' UNimportant , of course , I meant , ' the_King hastily said , and went on
to himself in an_undertone ,

' important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important-- ' as if he were trying
which_word sounded best .

Some of the_jury wrote it down ' important , ' and some ' unimportant . '
Alice could see this , as she was near enough to look over their_slates ;
' but it does n't matter a_bit , ' she thought to herself .

At this_moment the_King , who had been for some_time busily writing in
his_note - book , cackled out ' Silence ! ' and read out from his_book , ' Rule
Forty - two . ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A_MILE_HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT . '

Everybody looked at Alice .

' I'M not a mile high , ' said Alice .

' You are , ' said the_King .

' Nearly two miles high , ' added the_Queen .

' Well , I sha n't go , at any_rate , ' said Alice : ' besides , that 's not a
regular_rule : you invented it just now . '

' It 's the_oldest_rule in the_book , ' said the_King .

' Then it ought to be Number_One , ' said Alice .

The_King turned pale , and shut his_note - book hastily . ' Consider your
verdict , ' he said to the_jury , in a low , trembling voice .

' There 's more_evidence to come yet , please your Majesty , ' said the_White
Rabbit , jumping up in a_great_hurry ; ' this_paper has just been picked
up . '

' What 's in it ? ' said the_Queen .

' I haven't opened it yet , ' said the_White_Rabbit , ' but it seems to be a
letter , written by the_prisoner to -- to somebody . '

' It must have been that , ' said the_King , ' unless it was written to
nobody , which is n't usual , you know . '

' Who is it directed to ? ' said one of the_jurymen .

' It is n't directed at all , ' said the_White_Rabbit ; ' in fact , there 's
nothing written on the_OUTSIDE . ' He unfolded the_paper as he spoke , and
added ' It isn't_a_letter , after all : it 's a_set of verses . '

' Are they in the_prisoner's_handwriting ? ' asked another of the_jurymen .

' No , they 're not , ' said the_White_Rabbit , ' and that 's the_queerest_thing
about it . ' ( The_jury all looked puzzled . )

' He must have imitated somebody else 's hand , ' said the_King . ( The_jury
all brightened up again . )

' Please your_Majesty , ' said the_Knave , ' I did n't write it , and they
ca n't prove I did : there 's no_name signed at the_end . '

' If you didn't_sign_it , ' said the_King , ' that only makes the_matter
worse . You MUST have meant some_mischief , or else you 'd have signed your
name like an_honest_man . '

There was a_general_clapping of hands at this : it was the first really
clever_thing the_King had said that_day .

' That PROVES his_guilt , ' said the_Queen .

' It proves nothing of the_sort ! ' said Alice . ' Why , you do n't even know
what they 're about ! '

' Read them , ' said the_King .

The_White_Rabbit put on his_spectacles . ' Where shall I begin , please
your_Majesty ? ' he asked .

' Begin at the_beginning , ' the_King said gravely , ' and go on till you
come to the_end : then stop . '

These were the_verses the_White_Rabbit read:--

<unconvertable> ' They told me you had been to her ,
<unconvertable> And mentioned me to him :
_ _ _ She gave me a_good_character ,
<unconvertable> But said I could not swim .

_ _ _ He sent them word I had not gone
<unconvertable> ( We know it to be true ) :
<unconvertable> If she should push the_matter on ,
_ _ _ _ What would become of you ?

_ _ _ I gave her one , they gave him two ,
_ _ _ _ You gave us three or more ;
_ _ _ They all returned from him to you ,
<unconvertable> Though they were mine before .

_ _ _ If_I or she should chance to be
<unconvertable> Involved in this_affair ,
_ _ _ He trusts to you to set them free ,
<unconvertable> Exactly as we were .

_ _ _ My_notion was that you had been
<unconvertable> ( Before she had this_fit )
_ _ _ An_obstacle that came between
_ _ _ _ Him , and ourselves , and it .

<unconvertable> Do n't let him know she liked them best ,
<unconvertable> For this must ever be
_ _ _ A_secret , kept from all_the_rest ,
<unconvertable> Between yourself and me . '

' That 's the_most_important_piece of evidence we 've heard yet , ' said the
King , rubbing his_hands ; ' so now let the_jury-- '

' If any one of them can explain it , ' said Alice , ( she had grown so large
in the_last_few_minutes that she was n't a bit afraid of interrupting
him , ) ' I 'll give him sixpence . _ I _ do n't believe there 's an_atom of
meaning in it . '

The_jury all wrote down on their_slates , ' SHE does n't believe there 's an
atom of meaning in it , ' but none of them attempted to explain the_paper .

' If there 's no_meaning in it , ' said the_King , ' that saves a_world of
trouble , you know , as we need n't try to find any . And yet I do n't know , '
he went on , spreading out the_verses on his_knee , and looking at them
with one_eye ; ' I seem to see some_meaning in them , after all . <unconvertable> --SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM-- <unconvertable> you ca n't swim , can you ? ' he added , turning to the
Knave .

The_Knave shook his_head sadly . ' Do I look like it ? ' he said . ( Which_he
certainly did NOT , being made entirely of cardboard . )

' All right , so far , ' said the_King , and he went on muttering over
the_verses to himself : ' <unconvertable> WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE-- <unconvertable> that 's the_jury , of
course--I GAVE HER ONE , THEY GAVE HIM TWO-- <unconvertable> why , that must be what he
did with the_tarts , you know-- '

' But , it goes on <unconvertable> THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU , <unconvertable> ' said Alice .

' Why , there they are ! ' said the_King triumphantly , pointing to the_tarts
on the_table . ' Nothing can be clearer than THAT . Then again--BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS_FIT-- <unconvertable> you never had fits , my_dear , I think ? ' he said to the
Queen .

' Never ! ' said the_Queen furiously , throwing an_inkstand at the_Lizard
as she spoke . ( The_unfortunate_little_Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one_finger , as he found it made no_mark ; but he now hastily
began again , using the_ink , that was trickling down his_face , as long as
it lasted . )

' Then the_words do n't FIT you , ' said the_King , looking round the_court
with a_smile . There was a_dead_silence .

' It 's a_pun ! ' the_King added in an_offended_tone , and everybody laughed ,
' Let the_jury consider their_verdict , ' the King said , for about the
twentieth_time that day .

' No , no ! ' said the_Queen . ' Sentence first -- verdict afterwards . '

' Stuff and nonsense ! ' said Alice loudly . ' The_idea of having the
sentence first ! '

' Hold your_tongue ! ' said the_Queen , turning purple .

' I wo n't ! ' said Alice .

' Off with her head ! ' the_Queen shouted at the_top of her_voice . Nobody
moved .

' Who cares for you ? ' said Alice , ( she had grown to her_full_size by this
time . ) ' You 're nothing but a_pack of cards ! '

At this the_whole_pack rose up into the_air , and came flying down upon
her : she gave a_little_scream , half of fright and half of anger , and
tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the_bank , with her
head in the_lap of her_sister , who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the_trees upon her_face .

' Wake up , Alice_dear ! ' said her_sister ; ' Why , what_a_long_sleep you 've
had ! '

' Oh , I 've had such_a_curious_dream ! ' said Alice , and she told her
sister , as well as she could remember them , all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about ; and when she had
finished , her_sister kissed her , and said , ' It WAS a_curious_dream ,
dear , certainly : but now run in to your_tea ; it 's getting late . ' So
Alice got up and ran off , thinking while she ran , as well she might ,
what_a_wonderful_dream it had been .

But her_sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her_head on her
hand , watching the_setting_sun , and thinking of little_Alice and all her
wonderful_Adventures , till she too began dreaming after a_fashion , and
this was her dream:--

First , she dreamed of little_Alice herself , and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her_knee , and the_bright_eager_eyes were looking
up into hers -- she could hear the_very_tones of her_voice , and see that
queer little_toss of her_head to keep back the_wandering_hair that
WOULD always get into her_eyes -- and still as she listened , or seemed to
listen , the_whole_place around her became alive with the_strange_creatures
of her_little_sister 's dream .

The_long_grass rustled at her_feet as the_White_Rabbit hurried by -- the
frightened Mouse splashed his_way through the_neighbouring_pool -- she
could hear the_rattle of the_teacups as the_March_Hare and his_friends
shared their_never - ending_meal , and the_shrill_voice of the_Queen
ordering off her_unfortunate_guests to execution -- once more the pig - baby
was sneezing on the_Duchess's_knee , while plates and dishes crashed
around it -- once more the_shriek of the_Gryphon , the squeaking of the
Lizard 's slate - pencil , and the_choking of the_suppressed_guinea - pigs ,
filled the_air , mixed up with the_distant_sobs of the_miserable_Mock
Turtle .

So she sat on , with closed_eyes , and half believed herself in
Wonderland , though she knew she had but to open them again , and all
would change to dull_reality -- the_grass would be only rustling in the
wind , and the_pool rippling to the_waving of the_reeds -- the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep - bells , and the_Queen 's shrill
cries to the_voice of the_shepherd_boy -- and the_sneeze of the_baby , the
shriek of the_Gryphon , and all_the_other_queer_noises , would change ( she
knew ) to the_confused_clamour of the_busy_farm - yard -- while the_lowing
of the_cattle in the_distance would take the_place of the_Mock_Turtle 's
heavy_sobs .

Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would
keep , through all_her_riper_years , the simple and loving heart of her
childhood : and how she would gather about her_other_little_children , and
make THEIR_eyes bright and eager with many_a_strange_tale , perhaps even
with the_dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with
all their_simple_sorrows , and find a_pleasure in all_their_simple_joys ,
remembering her_own_child - life , and the_happy_summer_days .

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE_END
